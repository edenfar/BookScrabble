SHAKESPEARE HOMEPAGE | ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL | ENTIRE PLAY
ACT I

SCENE I. ROUSILLON. THE COUNT'S PALACE.

ENTER BERTRAM, THE COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, AND LAFEU, ALL IN BLACK
COUNTESS
IN DELIVERING MY SON FROM ME, I BURY A SECOND HUSBAND.
BERTRAM
AND I IN GOING, MADAM, WEEP O'ER MY FATHER'S DEATH
ANEW: BUT I MUST ATTEND HIS MAJESTY'S COMMAND, TO
WHOM I AM NOW IN WARD, EVERMORE IN SUBJECTION.
LAFEU
YOU SHALL FIND OF THE KING A HUSBAND, MADAM; YOU,
SIR, A FATHER: HE THAT SO GENERALLY IS AT ALL TIMES
GOOD MUST OF NECESSITY HOLD HIS VIRTUE TO YOU; WHOSE
WORTHINESS WOULD STIR IT UP WHERE IT WANTED RATHER
THAN LACK IT WHERE THERE IS SUCH ABUNDANCE.
COUNTESS
WHAT HOPE IS THERE OF HIS MAJESTY'S AMENDMENT?
LAFEU
HE HATH ABANDONED HIS PHYSICIANS, MADAM; UNDER WHOSE
PRACTISES HE HATH PERSECUTED TIME WITH HOPE, AND
FINDS NO OTHER ADVANTAGE IN THE PROCESS BUT ONLY THE
LOSING OF HOPE BY TIME.
COUNTESS
THIS YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN HAD A FATHER,--O, THAT
'HAD'! HOW SAD A PASSAGE 'TIS!--WHOSE SKILL WAS
ALMOST AS GREAT AS HIS HONESTY; HAD IT STRETCHED SO
FAR, WOULD HAVE MADE NATURE IMMORTAL, AND DEATH
SHOULD HAVE PLAY FOR LACK OF WORK. WOULD, FOR THE
KING'S SAKE, HE WERE LIVING! I THINK IT WOULD BE
THE DEATH OF THE KING'S DISEASE.
LAFEU
HOW CALLED YOU THE MAN YOU SPEAK OF, MADAM?
COUNTESS
HE WAS FAMOUS, SIR, IN HIS PROFESSION, AND IT WAS
HIS GREAT RIGHT TO BE SO: GERARD DE NARBON.
LAFEU
HE WAS EXCELLENT INDEED, MADAM: THE KING VERY
LATELY SPOKE OF HIM ADMIRINGLY AND MOURNINGLY: HE
WAS SKILFUL ENOUGH TO HAVE LIVED STILL, IF KNOWLEDGE
COULD BE SET UP AGAINST MORTALITY.
BERTRAM
WHAT IS IT, MY GOOD LORD, THE KING LANGUISHES OF?
LAFEU
A FISTULA, MY LORD.
BERTRAM
I HEARD NOT OF IT BEFORE.
LAFEU
I WOULD IT WERE NOT NOTORIOUS. WAS THIS GENTLEWOMAN
THE DAUGHTER OF GERARD DE NARBON?
COUNTESS
HIS SOLE CHILD, MY LORD, AND BEQUEATHED TO MY
OVERLOOKING. I HAVE THOSE HOPES OF HER GOOD THAT
HER EDUCATION PROMISES; HER DISPOSITIONS SHE
INHERITS, WHICH MAKES FAIR GIFTS FAIRER; FOR WHERE
AN UNCLEAN MIND CARRIES VIRTUOUS QUALITIES, THERE
COMMENDATIONS GO WITH PITY; THEY ARE VIRTUES AND
TRAITORS TOO; IN HER THEY ARE THE BETTER FOR THEIR
SIMPLENESS; SHE DERIVES HER HONESTY AND ACHIEVES HER GOODNESS.
LAFEU
YOUR COMMENDATIONS, MADAM, GET FROM HER TEARS.
COUNTESS
'TIS THE BEST BRINE A MAIDEN CAN SEASON HER PRAISE
IN. THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER FATHER NEVER APPROACHES
HER HEART BUT THE TYRANNY OF HER SORROWS TAKES ALL
LIVELIHOOD FROM HER CHEEK. NO MORE OF THIS, HELENA;
GO TO, NO MORE; LEST IT BE RATHER THOUGHT YOU AFFECT
A SORROW THAN HAVE IT.
HELENA
I DO AFFECT A SORROW INDEED, BUT I HAVE IT TOO.
LAFEU
MODERATE LAMENTATION IS THE RIGHT OF THE DEAD,
EXCESSIVE GRIEF THE ENEMY TO THE LIVING.
COUNTESS
IF THE LIVING BE ENEMY TO THE GRIEF, THE EXCESS
MAKES IT SOON MORTAL.
BERTRAM
MADAM, I DESIRE YOUR HOLY WISHES.
LAFEU
HOW UNDERSTAND WE THAT?
COUNTESS
BE THOU BLEST, BERTRAM, AND SUCCEED THY FATHER
IN MANNERS, AS IN SHAPE! THY BLOOD AND VIRTUE
CONTEND FOR EMPIRE IN THEE, AND THY GOODNESS
SHARE WITH THY BIRTHRIGHT! LOVE ALL, TRUST A FEW,
DO WRONG TO NONE: BE ABLE FOR THINE ENEMY
RATHER IN POWER THAN USE, AND KEEP THY FRIEND
UNDER THY OWN LIFE'S KEY: BE CHEQUE'D FOR SILENCE,
BUT NEVER TAX'D FOR SPEECH. WHAT HEAVEN MORE WILL,
THAT THEE MAY FURNISH AND MY PRAYERS PLUCK DOWN,
FALL ON THY HEAD! FAREWELL, MY LORD;
'TIS AN UNSEASON'D COURTIER; GOOD MY LORD,
ADVISE HIM.
LAFEU
HE CANNOT WANT THE BEST
THAT SHALL ATTEND HIS LOVE.
COUNTESS
HEAVEN BLESS HIM! FAREWELL, BERTRAM.
EXIT

BERTRAM
[TO HELENA] THE BEST WISHES THAT CAN BE FORGED IN
YOUR THOUGHTS BE SERVANTS TO YOU! BE COMFORTABLE
TO MY MOTHER, YOUR MISTRESS, AND MAKE MUCH OF HER.
LAFEU
FAREWELL, PRETTY LADY: YOU MUST HOLD THE CREDIT OF
YOUR FATHER.
EXEUNT BERTRAM AND LAFEU

HELENA
O, WERE THAT ALL! I THINK NOT ON MY FATHER;
AND THESE GREAT TEARS GRACE HIS REMEMBRANCE MORE
THAN THOSE I SHED FOR HIM. WHAT WAS HE LIKE?
I HAVE FORGOT HIM: MY IMAGINATION
CARRIES NO FAVOUR IN'T BUT BERTRAM'S.
I AM UNDONE: THERE IS NO LIVING, NONE,
IF BERTRAM BE AWAY. 'TWERE ALL ONE
THAT I SHOULD LOVE A BRIGHT PARTICULAR STAR
AND THINK TO WED IT, HE IS SO ABOVE ME:
IN HIS BRIGHT RADIANCE AND COLLATERAL LIGHT
MUST I BE COMFORTED, NOT IN HIS SPHERE.
THE AMBITION IN MY LOVE THUS PLAGUES ITSELF:
THE HIND THAT WOULD BE MATED BY THE LION
MUST DIE FOR LOVE. 'TWAS PRETTY, THOUGH PLAGUE,
TO SEE HIM EVERY HOUR; TO SIT AND DRAW
HIS ARCHED BROWS, HIS HAWKING EYE, HIS CURLS,
IN OUR HEART'S TABLE; HEART TOO CAPABLE
OF EVERY LINE AND TRICK OF HIS SWEET FAVOUR:
BUT NOW HE'S GONE, AND MY IDOLATROUS FANCY
MUST SANCTIFY HIS RELIQUES. WHO COMES HERE?
ENTER PAROLLES

ASIDE

ONE THAT GOES WITH HIM: I LOVE HIM FOR HIS SAKE;
AND YET I KNOW HIM A NOTORIOUS LIAR,
THINK HIM A GREAT WAY FOOL, SOLELY A COWARD;
YET THESE FIXED EVILS SIT SO FIT IN HIM,
THAT THEY TAKE PLACE, WHEN VIRTUE'S STEELY BONES
LOOK BLEAK I' THE COLD WIND: WITHAL, FULL OFT WE SEE
COLD WISDOM WAITING ON SUPERFLUOUS FOLLY.
PAROLLES
SAVE YOU, FAIR QUEEN!
HELENA
AND YOU, MONARCH!
PAROLLES
NO.
HELENA
AND NO.
PAROLLES
ARE YOU MEDITATING ON VIRGINITY?
HELENA
AY. YOU HAVE SOME STAIN OF SOLDIER IN YOU: LET ME
ASK YOU A QUESTION. MAN IS ENEMY TO VIRGINITY; HOW
MAY WE BARRICADO IT AGAINST HIM?
PAROLLES
KEEP HIM OUT.
HELENA
BUT HE ASSAILS; AND OUR VIRGINITY, THOUGH VALIANT,
IN THE DEFENCE YET IS WEAK: UNFOLD TO US SOME
WARLIKE RESISTANCE.
PAROLLES
THERE IS NONE: MAN, SITTING DOWN BEFORE YOU, WILL
UNDERMINE YOU AND BLOW YOU UP.
HELENA
BLESS OUR POOR VIRGINITY FROM UNDERMINERS AND
BLOWERS UP! IS THERE NO MILITARY POLICY, HOW
VIRGINS MIGHT BLOW UP MEN?
PAROLLES
VIRGINITY BEING BLOWN DOWN, MAN WILL QUICKLIER BE
BLOWN UP: MARRY, IN BLOWING HIM DOWN AGAIN, WITH
THE BREACH YOURSELVES MADE, YOU LOSE YOUR CITY. IT
IS NOT POLITIC IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF NATURE TO
PRESERVE VIRGINITY. LOSS OF VIRGINITY IS RATIONAL
INCREASE AND THERE WAS NEVER VIRGIN GOT TILL
VIRGINITY WAS FIRST LOST. THAT YOU WERE MADE OF IS
METAL TO MAKE VIRGINS. VIRGINITY BY BEING ONCE LOST
MAY BE TEN TIMES FOUND; BY BEING EVER KEPT, IT IS
EVER LOST: 'TIS TOO COLD A COMPANION; AWAY WITH 'T!
HELENA
I WILL STAND FOR 'T A LITTLE, THOUGH THEREFORE I DIE A VIRGIN.
PAROLLES
THERE'S LITTLE CAN BE SAID IN 'T; 'TIS AGAINST THE
RULE OF NATURE. TO SPEAK ON THE PART OF VIRGINITY,
IS TO ACCUSE YOUR MOTHERS; WHICH IS MOST INFALLIBLE
DISOBEDIENCE. HE THAT HANGS HIMSELF IS A VIRGIN:
VIRGINITY MURDERS ITSELF AND SHOULD BE BURIED IN
HIGHWAYS OUT OF ALL SANCTIFIED LIMIT, AS A DESPERATE
OFFENDRESS AGAINST NATURE. VIRGINITY BREEDS MITES,
MUCH LIKE A CHEESE; CONSUMES ITSELF TO THE VERY
PARING, AND SO DIES WITH FEEDING HIS OWN STOMACH.
BESIDES, VIRGINITY IS PEEVISH, PROUD, IDLE, MADE OF
SELF-LOVE, WHICH IS THE MOST INHIBITED SIN IN THE
CANON. KEEP IT NOT; YOU CANNOT CHOOSE BUT LOOSE
BY'T: OUT WITH 'T! WITHIN TEN YEAR IT WILL MAKE
ITSELF TEN, WHICH IS A GOODLY INCREASE; AND THE
PRINCIPAL ITSELF NOT MUCH THE WORSE: AWAY WITH 'T!
HELENA
HOW MIGHT ONE DO, SIR, TO LOSE IT TO HER OWN LIKING?
PAROLLES
LET ME SEE: MARRY, ILL, TO LIKE HIM THAT NE'ER IT
LIKES. 'TIS A COMMODITY WILL LOSE THE GLOSS WITH
LYING; THE LONGER KEPT, THE LESS WORTH: OFF WITH 'T
WHILE 'TIS VENDIBLE; ANSWER THE TIME OF REQUEST.
VIRGINITY, LIKE AN OLD COURTIER, WEARS HER CAP OUT
OF FASHION: RICHLY SUITED, BUT UNSUITABLE: JUST
LIKE THE BROOCH AND THE TOOTH-PICK, WHICH WEAR NOT
NOW. YOUR DATE IS BETTER IN YOUR PIE AND YOUR
PORRIDGE THAN IN YOUR CHEEK; AND YOUR VIRGINITY,
YOUR OLD VIRGINITY, IS LIKE ONE OF OUR FRENCH
WITHERED PEARS, IT LOOKS ILL, IT EATS DRILY; MARRY,
'TIS A WITHERED PEAR; IT WAS FORMERLY BETTER;
MARRY, YET 'TIS A WITHERED PEAR: WILL YOU ANYTHING WITH IT?
HELENA
NOT MY VIRGINITY YET [ ]
THERE SHALL YOUR MASTER HAVE A THOUSAND LOVES,
A MOTHER AND A MISTRESS AND A FRIEND,
A PHOENIX, CAPTAIN AND AN ENEMY,
A GUIDE, A GODDESS, AND A SOVEREIGN,
A COUNSELLOR, A TRAITRESS, AND A DEAR;
HIS HUMBLE AMBITION, PROUD HUMILITY,
HIS JARRING CONCORD, AND HIS DISCORD DULCET,
HIS FAITH, HIS SWEET DISASTER; WITH A WORLD
OF PRETTY, FOND, ADOPTIOUS CHRISTENDOMS,
THAT BLINKING CUPID GOSSIPS. NOW SHALL HE--
I KNOW NOT WHAT HE SHALL. GOD SEND HIM WELL!
THE COURT'S A LEARNING PLACE, AND HE IS ONE--
PAROLLES
WHAT ONE, I' FAITH?
HELENA
THAT I WISH WELL. 'TIS PITY--
PAROLLES
WHAT'S PITY?
HELENA
THAT WISHING WELL HAD NOT A BODY IN'T,
WHICH MIGHT BE FELT; THAT WE, THE POORER BORN,
WHOSE BASER STARS DO SHUT US UP IN WISHES,
MIGHT WITH EFFECTS OF THEM FOLLOW OUR FRIENDS,
AND SHOW WHAT WE ALONE MUST THINK, WHICH NEVER
RETURN US THANKS.

PAROLLES
LITTLE HELEN, FAREWELL; IF I CAN REMEMBER THEE, I
WILL THINK OF THEE AT COURT.
HELENA
MONSIEUR PAROLLES, YOU WERE BORN UNDER A CHARITABLE STAR.
PAROLLES
UNDER MARS, I.
HELENA
I ESPECIALLY THINK, UNDER MARS.
PAROLLES
WHY UNDER MARS?
HELENA
THE WARS HAVE SO KEPT YOU UNDER THAT YOU MUST NEEDS
BE BORN UNDER MARS.
PAROLLES
WHEN HE WAS PREDOMINANT.
HELENA
WHEN HE WAS RETROGRADE, I THINK, RATHER.
PAROLLES
WHY THINK YOU SO?
HELENA
YOU GO SO MUCH BACKWARD WHEN YOU FIGHT.
PAROLLES
THAT'S FOR ADVANTAGE.
HELENA
SO IS RUNNING AWAY, WHEN FEAR PROPOSES THE SAFETY;
BUT THE COMPOSITION THAT YOUR VALOUR AND FEAR MAKES
IN YOU IS A VIRTUE OF A GOOD WING, AND I LIKE THE WEAR WELL.
PAROLLES
I AM SO FULL OF BUSINESSES, I CANNOT ANSWER THEE
ACUTELY. I WILL RETURN PERFECT COURTIER; IN THE
WHICH, MY INSTRUCTION SHALL SERVE TO NATURALIZE
THEE, SO THOU WILT BE CAPABLE OF A COURTIER'S
COUNSEL AND UNDERSTAND WHAT ADVICE SHALL THRUST UPON
THEE; ELSE THOU DIEST IN THINE UNTHANKFULNESS, AND
THINE IGNORANCE MAKES THEE AWAY: FAREWELL. WHEN
THOU HAST LEISURE, SAY THY PRAYERS; WHEN THOU HAST
NONE, REMEMBER THY FRIENDS; GET THEE A GOOD HUSBAND,
AND USE HIM AS HE USES THEE; SO, FAREWELL.
EXIT

HELENA
OUR REMEDIES OFT IN OURSELVES DO LIE,
WHICH WE ASCRIBE TO HEAVEN: THE FATED SKY
GIVES US FREE SCOPE, ONLY DOTH BACKWARD PULL
OUR SLOW DESIGNS WHEN WE OURSELVES ARE DULL.
WHAT POWER IS IT WHICH MOUNTS MY LOVE SO HIGH,
THAT MAKES ME SEE, AND CANNOT FEED MINE EYE?
THE MIGHTIEST SPACE IN FORTUNE NATURE BRINGS
TO JOIN LIKE LIKES AND KISS LIKE NATIVE THINGS.
IMPOSSIBLE BE STRANGE ATTEMPTS TO THOSE
THAT WEIGH THEIR PAINS IN SENSE AND DO SUPPOSE
WHAT HATH BEEN CANNOT BE: WHO EVER STROVE
SO SHOW HER MERIT, THAT DID MISS HER LOVE?
THE KING'S DISEASE--MY PROJECT MAY DECEIVE ME,
BUT MY INTENTS ARE FIX'D AND WILL NOT LEAVE ME.

SCENE II. PARIS. THE KING'S PALACE.

FLOURISH OF CORNETS. ENTER THE KING OF FRANCE, WITH LETTERS, AND DIVERS ATTENDANTS
KING
THE FLORENTINES AND SENOYS ARE BY THE EARS;
HAVE FOUGHT WITH EQUAL FORTUNE AND CONTINUE
A BRAVING WAR.
FIRST LORD
SO 'TIS REPORTED, SIR.
KING
NAY, 'TIS MOST CREDIBLE; WE HERE RECEIVED IT
A CERTAINTY, VOUCH'D FROM OUR COUSIN AUSTRIA,
WITH CAUTION THAT THE FLORENTINE WILL MOVE US
FOR SPEEDY AID; WHEREIN OUR DEAREST FRIEND
PREJUDICATES THE BUSINESS AND WOULD SEEM
TO HAVE US MAKE DENIAL.
FIRST LORD
HIS LOVE AND WISDOM,
APPROVED SO TO YOUR MAJESTY, MAY PLEAD
FOR AMPLEST CREDENCE.
KING
HE HATH ARM'D OUR ANSWER,
AND FLORENCE IS DENIED BEFORE HE COMES:
YET, FOR OUR GENTLEMEN THAT MEAN TO SEE
THE TUSCAN SERVICE, FREELY HAVE THEY LEAVE
TO STAND ON EITHER PART.
SECOND LORD
IT WELL MAY SERVE
A NURSERY TO OUR GENTRY, WHO ARE SICK
FOR BREATHING AND EXPLOIT.
KING
WHAT'S HE COMES HERE?
ENTER BERTRAM, LAFEU, AND PAROLLES

FIRST LORD
IT IS THE COUNT ROUSILLON, MY GOOD LORD,
YOUNG BERTRAM.
KING
YOUTH, THOU BEAR'ST THY FATHER'S FACE;
FRANK NATURE, RATHER CURIOUS THAN IN HASTE,
HATH WELL COMPOSED THEE. THY FATHER'S MORAL PARTS
MAYST THOU INHERIT TOO! WELCOME TO PARIS.
BERTRAM
MY THANKS AND DUTY ARE YOUR MAJESTY'S.
KING
I WOULD I HAD THAT CORPORAL SOUNDNESS NOW,
AS WHEN THY FATHER AND MYSELF IN FRIENDSHIP
FIRST TRIED OUR SOLDIERSHIP! HE DID LOOK FAR
INTO THE SERVICE OF THE TIME AND WAS
DISCIPLED OF THE BRAVEST: HE LASTED LONG;
BUT ON US BOTH DID HAGGISH AGE STEAL ON
AND WORE US OUT OF ACT. IT MUCH REPAIRS ME
TO TALK OF YOUR GOOD FATHER. IN HIS YOUTH
HE HAD THE WIT WHICH I CAN WELL OBSERVE
TO-DAY IN OUR YOUNG LORDS; BUT THEY MAY JEST
TILL THEIR OWN SCORN RETURN TO THEM UNNOTED
ERE THEY CAN HIDE THEIR LEVITY IN HONOUR;
SO LIKE A COURTIER, CONTEMPT NOR BITTERNESS
WERE IN HIS PRIDE OR SHARPNESS; IF THEY WERE,
HIS EQUAL HAD AWAKED THEM, AND HIS HONOUR,
CLOCK TO ITSELF, KNEW THE TRUE MINUTE WHEN
EXCEPTION BID HIM SPEAK, AND AT THIS TIME
HIS TONGUE OBEY'D HIS HAND: WHO WERE BELOW HIM
HE USED AS CREATURES OF ANOTHER PLACE
AND BOW'D HIS EMINENT TOP TO THEIR LOW RANKS,
MAKING THEM PROUD OF HIS HUMILITY,
IN THEIR POOR PRAISE HE HUMBLED. SUCH A MAN
MIGHT BE A COPY TO THESE YOUNGER TIMES;
WHICH, FOLLOW'D WELL, WOULD DEMONSTRATE THEM NOW
BUT GOERS BACKWARD.
BERTRAM
HIS GOOD REMEMBRANCE, SIR,
LIES RICHER IN YOUR THOUGHTS THAN ON HIS TOMB;
SO IN APPROOF LIVES NOT HIS EPITAPH
AS IN YOUR ROYAL SPEECH.
KING
WOULD I WERE WITH HIM! HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY--
METHINKS I HEAR HIM NOW; HIS PLAUSIVE WORDS
HE SCATTER'D NOT IN EARS, BUT GRAFTED THEM,
TO GROW THERE AND TO BEAR,--'LET ME NOT LIVE,'--
THIS HIS GOOD MELANCHOLY OFT BEGAN,
ON THE CATASTROPHE AND HEEL OF PASTIME,
WHEN IT WAS OUT,--'LET ME NOT LIVE,' QUOTH HE,
'AFTER MY FLAME LACKS OIL, TO BE THE SNUFF
OF YOUNGER SPIRITS, WHOSE APPREHENSIVE SENSES
ALL BUT NEW THINGS DISDAIN; WHOSE JUDGMENTS ARE
MERE FATHERS OF THEIR GARMENTS; WHOSE CONSTANCIES
EXPIRE BEFORE THEIR FASHIONS.' THIS HE WISH'D;
I AFTER HIM DO AFTER HIM WISH TOO,
SINCE I NOR WAX NOR HONEY CAN BRING HOME,
I QUICKLY WERE DISSOLVED FROM MY HIVE,
TO GIVE SOME LABOURERS ROOM.
SECOND LORD
YOU ARE LOVED, SIR:
THEY THAT LEAST LEND IT YOU SHALL LACK YOU FIRST.
KING
I FILL A PLACE, I KNOW'T. HOW LONG IS'T, COUNT,
SINCE THE PHYSICIAN AT YOUR FATHER'S DIED?
HE WAS MUCH FAMED.
BERTRAM
SOME SIX MONTHS SINCE, MY LORD.
KING
IF HE WERE LIVING, I WOULD TRY HIM YET.
LEND ME AN ARM; THE REST HAVE WORN ME OUT
WITH SEVERAL APPLICATIONS; NATURE AND SICKNESS
DEBATE IT AT THEIR LEISURE. WELCOME, COUNT;
MY SON'S NO DEARER.
BERTRAM
THANK YOUR MAJESTY.
EXEUNT. FLOURISH

SCENE III. ROUSILLON. THE COUNT'S PALACE.

ENTER COUNTESS, STEWARD, AND CLOWN
COUNTESS
I WILL NOW HEAR; WHAT SAY YOU OF THIS GENTLEWOMAN?
STEWARD
MADAM, THE CARE I HAVE HAD TO EVEN YOUR CONTENT, I
WISH MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE CALENDAR OF MY PAST
ENDEAVOURS; FOR THEN WE WOUND OUR MODESTY AND MAKE
FOUL THE CLEARNESS OF OUR DESERVINGS, WHEN OF
OURSELVES WE PUBLISH THEM.
COUNTESS
WHAT DOES THIS KNAVE HERE? GET YOU GONE, SIRRAH:
THE COMPLAINTS I HAVE HEARD OF YOU I DO NOT ALL
BELIEVE: 'TIS MY SLOWNESS THAT I DO NOT; FOR I KNOW
YOU LACK NOT FOLLY TO COMMIT THEM, AND HAVE ABILITY
ENOUGH TO MAKE SUCH KNAVERIES YOURS.
CLOWN
'TIS NOT UNKNOWN TO YOU, MADAM, I AM A POOR FELLOW.
COUNTESS
WELL, SIR.
CLOWN
NO, MADAM, 'TIS NOT SO WELL THAT I AM POOR, THOUGH
MANY OF THE RICH ARE DAMNED: BUT, IF I MAY HAVE
YOUR LADYSHIP'S GOOD WILL TO GO TO THE WORLD, ISBEL
THE WOMAN AND I WILL DO AS WE MAY.
COUNTESS
WILT THOU NEEDS BE A BEGGAR?
CLOWN
I DO BEG YOUR GOOD WILL IN THIS CASE.
COUNTESS
IN WHAT CASE?
CLOWN
IN ISBEL'S CASE AND MINE OWN. SERVICE IS NO
HERITAGE: AND I THINK I SHALL NEVER HAVE THE
BLESSING OF GOD TILL I HAVE ISSUE O' MY BODY; FOR
THEY SAY BARNES ARE BLESSINGS.
COUNTESS
TELL ME THY REASON WHY THOU WILT MARRY.
CLOWN
MY POOR BODY, MADAM, REQUIRES IT: I AM DRIVEN ON
BY THE FLESH; AND HE MUST NEEDS GO THAT THE DEVIL DRIVES.
COUNTESS
IS THIS ALL YOUR WORSHIP'S REASON?
CLOWN
FAITH, MADAM, I HAVE OTHER HOLY REASONS SUCH AS THEY
ARE.
COUNTESS
MAY THE WORLD KNOW THEM?
CLOWN
I HAVE BEEN, MADAM, A WICKED CREATURE, AS YOU AND
ALL FLESH AND BLOOD ARE; AND, INDEED, I DO MARRY
THAT I MAY REPENT.
COUNTESS
THY MARRIAGE, SOONER THAN THY WICKEDNESS.
CLOWN
I AM OUT O' FRIENDS, MADAM; AND I HOPE TO HAVE
FRIENDS FOR MY WIFE'S SAKE.
COUNTESS
SUCH FRIENDS ARE THINE ENEMIES, KNAVE.
CLOWN
YOU'RE SHALLOW, MADAM, IN GREAT FRIENDS; FOR THE
KNAVES COME TO DO THAT FOR ME WHICH I AM AWEARY OF.
HE THAT EARS MY LAND SPARES MY TEAM AND GIVES ME
LEAVE TO IN THE CROP; IF I BE HIS CUCKOLD, HE'S MY
DRUDGE: HE THAT COMFORTS MY WIFE IS THE CHERISHER
OF MY FLESH AND BLOOD; HE THAT CHERISHES MY FLESH
AND BLOOD LOVES MY FLESH AND BLOOD; HE THAT LOVES MY
FLESH AND BLOOD IS MY FRIEND: ERGO, HE THAT KISSES
MY WIFE IS MY FRIEND. IF MEN COULD BE CONTENTED TO
BE WHAT THEY ARE, THERE WERE NO FEAR IN MARRIAGE;
FOR YOUNG CHARBON THE PURITAN AND OLD POYSAM THE
PAPIST, HOWSOME'ER THEIR HEARTS ARE SEVERED IN
RELIGION, THEIR HEADS ARE BOTH ONE; THEY MAY JOWL
HORNS TOGETHER, LIKE ANY DEER I' THE HERD.
COUNTESS
WILT THOU EVER BE A FOUL-MOUTHED AND CALUMNIOUS KNAVE?
CLOWN
A PROPHET I, MADAM; AND I SPEAK THE TRUTH THE NEXT
WAY:
FOR I THE BALLAD WILL REPEAT,
WHICH MEN FULL TRUE SHALL FIND;
YOUR MARRIAGE COMES BY DESTINY,
YOUR CUCKOO SINGS BY KIND.
COUNTESS
GET YOU GONE, SIR; I'LL TALK WITH YOU MORE ANON.
STEWARD
MAY IT PLEASE YOU, MADAM, THAT HE BID HELEN COME TO
YOU: OF HER I AM TO SPEAK.
COUNTESS
SIRRAH, TELL MY GENTLEWOMAN I WOULD SPEAK WITH HER;
HELEN, I MEAN.
CLOWN
WAS THIS FAIR FACE THE CAUSE, QUOTH SHE,
WHY THE GRECIANS SACKED TROY?
FOND DONE, DONE FOND,
WAS THIS KING PRIAM'S JOY?
WITH THAT SHE SIGHED AS SHE STOOD,
WITH THAT SHE SIGHED AS SHE STOOD,
AND GAVE THIS SENTENCE THEN;
AMONG NINE BAD IF ONE BE GOOD,
AMONG NINE BAD IF ONE BE GOOD,
THERE'S YET ONE GOOD IN TEN.
COUNTESS
WHAT, ONE GOOD IN TEN? YOU CORRUPT THE SONG, SIRRAH.
CLOWN
ONE GOOD WOMAN IN TEN, MADAM; WHICH IS A PURIFYING
O' THE SONG: WOULD GOD WOULD SERVE THE WORLD SO ALL
THE YEAR! WE'LD FIND NO FAULT WITH THE TITHE-WOMAN,
IF I WERE THE PARSON. ONE IN TEN, QUOTH A'! AN WE
MIGHT HAVE A GOOD WOMAN BORN BUT ONE EVERY BLAZING
STAR, OR AT AN EARTHQUAKE, 'TWOULD MEND THE LOTTERY
WELL: A MAN MAY DRAW HIS HEART OUT, ERE A' PLUCK
ONE.
COUNTESS
YOU'LL BE GONE, SIR KNAVE, AND DO AS I COMMAND YOU.
CLOWN
THAT MAN SHOULD BE AT WOMAN'S COMMAND, AND YET NO
HURT DONE! THOUGH HONESTY BE NO PURITAN, YET IT
WILL DO NO HURT; IT WILL WEAR THE SURPLICE OF
HUMILITY OVER THE BLACK GOWN OF A BIG HEART. I AM
GOING, FORSOOTH: THE BUSINESS IS FOR HELEN TO COME HITHER.
EXIT

COUNTESS
WELL, NOW.
STEWARD
I KNOW, MADAM, YOU LOVE YOUR GENTLEWOMAN ENTIRELY.
COUNTESS
FAITH, I DO: HER FATHER BEQUEATHED HER TO ME; AND
SHE HERSELF, WITHOUT OTHER ADVANTAGE, MAY LAWFULLY
MAKE TITLE TO AS MUCH LOVE AS SHE FINDS: THERE IS
MORE OWING HER THAN IS PAID; AND MORE SHALL BE PAID
HER THAN SHE'LL DEMAND.
STEWARD
MADAM, I WAS VERY LATE MORE NEAR HER THAN I THINK
SHE WISHED ME: ALONE SHE WAS, AND DID COMMUNICATE
TO HERSELF HER OWN WORDS TO HER OWN EARS; SHE
THOUGHT, I DARE VOW FOR HER, THEY TOUCHED NOT ANY
STRANGER SENSE. HER MATTER WAS, SHE LOVED YOUR SON:
FORTUNE, SHE SAID, WAS NO GODDESS, THAT HAD PUT
SUCH DIFFERENCE BETWIXT THEIR TWO ESTATES; LOVE NO
GOD, THAT WOULD NOT EXTEND HIS MIGHT, ONLY WHERE
QUALITIES WERE LEVEL; DIAN NO QUEEN OF VIRGINS, THAT
WOULD SUFFER HER POOR KNIGHT SURPRISED, WITHOUT
RESCUE IN THE FIRST ASSAULT OR RANSOM AFTERWARD.
THIS SHE DELIVERED IN THE MOST BITTER TOUCH OF
SORROW THAT E'ER I HEARD VIRGIN EXCLAIM IN: WHICH I
HELD MY DUTY SPEEDILY TO ACQUAINT YOU WITHAL;
SITHENCE, IN THE LOSS THAT MAY HAPPEN, IT CONCERNS
YOU SOMETHING TO KNOW IT.
COUNTESS
YOU HAVE DISCHARGED THIS HONESTLY; KEEP IT TO
YOURSELF: MANY LIKELIHOODS INFORMED ME OF THIS
BEFORE, WHICH HUNG SO TOTTERING IN THE BALANCE THAT
I COULD NEITHER BELIEVE NOR MISDOUBT. PRAY YOU,
LEAVE ME: STALL THIS IN YOUR BOSOM; AND I THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HONEST CARE: I WILL SPEAK WITH YOU FURTHER ANON.
EXIT STEWARD

ENTER HELENA

EVEN SO IT WAS WITH ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG:
IF EVER WE ARE NATURE'S, THESE ARE OURS; THIS THORN
DOTH TO OUR ROSE OF YOUTH RIGHTLY BELONG;
OUR BLOOD TO US, THIS TO OUR BLOOD IS BORN;
IT IS THE SHOW AND SEAL OF NATURE'S TRUTH,
WHERE LOVE'S STRONG PASSION IS IMPRESS'D IN YOUTH:
BY OUR REMEMBRANCES OF DAYS FOREGONE,
SUCH WERE OUR FAULTS, OR THEN WE THOUGHT THEM NONE.
HER EYE IS SICK ON'T: I OBSERVE HER NOW.
HELENA
WHAT IS YOUR PLEASURE, MADAM?
COUNTESS
YOU KNOW, HELEN,
I AM A MOTHER TO YOU.
HELENA
MINE HONOURABLE MISTRESS.
COUNTESS
NAY, A MOTHER:
WHY NOT A MOTHER? WHEN I SAID 'A MOTHER,'
METHOUGHT YOU SAW A SERPENT: WHAT'S IN 'MOTHER,'
THAT YOU START AT IT? I SAY, I AM YOUR MOTHER;
AND PUT YOU IN THE CATALOGUE OF THOSE
THAT WERE ENWOMBED MINE: 'TIS OFTEN SEEN
ADOPTION STRIVES WITH NATURE AND CHOICE BREEDS
A NATIVE SLIP TO US FROM FOREIGN SEEDS:
YOU NE'ER OPPRESS'D ME WITH A MOTHER'S GROAN,
YET I EXPRESS TO YOU A MOTHER'S CARE:
GOD'S MERCY, MAIDEN! DOES IT CURD THY BLOOD
TO SAY I AM THY MOTHER? WHAT'S THE MATTER,
THAT THIS DISTEMPER'D MESSENGER OF WET,
THE MANY-COLOUR'D IRIS, ROUNDS THINE EYE?
WHY? THAT YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER?
HELENA
THAT I AM NOT.
COUNTESS
I SAY, I AM YOUR MOTHER.
HELENA
PARDON, MADAM;
THE COUNT ROUSILLON CANNOT BE MY BROTHER:
I AM FROM HUMBLE, HE FROM HONOUR'D NAME;
NO NOTE UPON MY PARENTS, HIS ALL NOBLE:
MY MASTER, MY DEAR LORD HE IS; AND I
HIS SERVANT LIVE, AND WILL HIS VASSAL DIE:
HE MUST NOT BE MY BROTHER.
COUNTESS
NOR I YOUR MOTHER?
HELENA
YOU ARE MY MOTHER, MADAM; WOULD YOU WERE,--
SO THAT MY LORD YOUR SON WERE NOT MY BROTHER,--
INDEED MY MOTHER! OR WERE YOU BOTH OUR MOTHERS,
I CARE NO MORE FOR THAN I DO FOR HEAVEN,
SO I WERE NOT HIS SISTER. CAN'T NO OTHER,
BUT, I YOUR DAUGHTER, HE MUST BE MY BROTHER?
COUNTESS
YES, HELEN, YOU MIGHT BE MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW:
GOD SHIELD YOU MEAN IT NOT! DAUGHTER AND MOTHER
SO STRIVE UPON YOUR PULSE. WHAT, PALE AGAIN?
MY FEAR HATH CATCH'D YOUR FONDNESS: NOW I SEE
THE MYSTERY OF YOUR LONELINESS, AND FIND
YOUR SALT TEARS' HEAD: NOW TO ALL SENSE 'TIS GROSS
YOU LOVE MY SON; INVENTION IS ASHAMED,
AGAINST THE PROCLAMATION OF THY PASSION,
TO SAY THOU DOST NOT: THEREFORE TELL ME TRUE;
BUT TELL ME THEN, 'TIS SO; FOR, LOOK THY CHEEKS
CONFESS IT, TH' ONE TO TH' OTHER; AND THINE EYES
SEE IT SO GROSSLY SHOWN IN THY BEHAVIORS
THAT IN THEIR KIND THEY SPEAK IT: ONLY SIN
AND HELLISH OBSTINACY TIE THY TONGUE,
THAT TRUTH SHOULD BE SUSPECTED. SPEAK, IS'T SO?
IF IT BE SO, YOU HAVE WOUND A GOODLY CLEW;
IF IT BE NOT, FORSWEAR'T: HOWE'ER, I CHARGE THEE,
AS HEAVEN SHALL WORK IN ME FOR THINE AVAIL,
TELL ME TRULY.
HELENA
GOOD MADAM, PARDON ME!
COUNTESS
DO YOU LOVE MY SON?
HELENA
YOUR PARDON, NOBLE MISTRESS!
COUNTESS
LOVE YOU MY SON?
HELENA
DO NOT YOU LOVE HIM, MADAM?
COUNTESS
GO NOT ABOUT; MY LOVE HATH IN'T A BOND,
WHEREOF THE WORLD TAKES NOTE: COME, COME, DISCLOSE
THE STATE OF YOUR AFFECTION; FOR YOUR PASSIONS
HAVE TO THE FULL APPEACH'D.
HELENA
THEN, I CONFESS,
HERE ON MY KNEE, BEFORE HIGH HEAVEN AND YOU,
THAT BEFORE YOU, AND NEXT UNTO HIGH HEAVEN,
I LOVE YOUR SON.
MY FRIENDS WERE POOR, BUT HONEST; SO'S MY LOVE:
BE NOT OFFENDED; FOR IT HURTS NOT HIM
THAT HE IS LOVED OF ME: I FOLLOW HIM NOT
BY ANY TOKEN OF PRESUMPTUOUS SUIT;
NOR WOULD I HAVE HIM TILL I DO DESERVE HIM;
YET NEVER KNOW HOW THAT DESERT SHOULD BE.
I KNOW I LOVE IN VAIN, STRIVE AGAINST HOPE;
YET IN THIS CAPTIOUS AND INTENIBLE SIEVE
I STILL POUR IN THE WATERS OF MY LOVE
AND LACK NOT TO LOSE STILL: THUS, INDIAN-LIKE,
RELIGIOUS IN MINE ERROR, I ADORE
THE SUN, THAT LOOKS UPON HIS WORSHIPPER,
BUT KNOWS OF HIM NO MORE. MY DEAREST MADAM,
LET NOT YOUR HATE ENCOUNTER WITH MY LOVE
FOR LOVING WHERE YOU DO: BUT IF YOURSELF,
WHOSE AGED HONOUR CITES A VIRTUOUS YOUTH,
DID EVER IN SO TRUE A FLAME OF LIKING
WISH CHASTELY AND LOVE DEARLY, THAT YOUR DIAN
WAS BOTH HERSELF AND LOVE: O, THEN, GIVE PITY
TO HER, WHOSE STATE IS SUCH THAT CANNOT CHOOSE
BUT LEND AND GIVE WHERE SHE IS SURE TO LOSE;
THAT SEEKS NOT TO FIND THAT HER SEARCH IMPLIES,
BUT RIDDLE-LIKE LIVES SWEETLY WHERE SHE DIES!
COUNTESS
HAD YOU NOT LATELY AN INTENT,--SPEAK TRULY,--
TO GO TO PARIS?
HELENA
MADAM, I HAD.
COUNTESS
WHEREFORE? TELL TRUE.
HELENA
I WILL TELL TRUTH; BY GRACE ITSELF I SWEAR.
YOU KNOW MY FATHER LEFT ME SOME PRESCRIPTIONS
OF RARE AND PROVED EFFECTS, SUCH AS HIS READING
AND MANIFEST EXPERIENCE HAD COLLECTED
FOR GENERAL SOVEREIGNTY; AND THAT HE WILL'D ME
IN HEEDFULL'ST RESERVATION TO BESTOW THEM,
AS NOTES WHOSE FACULTIES INCLUSIVE WERE
MORE THAN THEY WERE IN NOTE: AMONGST THE REST,
THERE IS A REMEDY, APPROVED, SET DOWN,
TO CURE THE DESPERATE LANGUISHINGS WHEREOF
THE KING IS RENDER'D LOST.
COUNTESS
THIS WAS YOUR MOTIVE
FOR PARIS, WAS IT? SPEAK.
HELENA
MY LORD YOUR SON MADE ME TO THINK OF THIS;
ELSE PARIS AND THE MEDICINE AND THE KING
HAD FROM THE CONVERSATION OF MY THOUGHTS
HAPLY BEEN ABSENT THEN.
COUNTESS
BUT THINK YOU, HELEN,
IF YOU SHOULD TENDER YOUR SUPPOSED AID,
HE WOULD RECEIVE IT? HE AND HIS PHYSICIANS
ARE OF A MIND; HE, THAT THEY CANNOT HELP HIM,
THEY, THAT THEY CANNOT HELP: HOW SHALL THEY CREDIT
A POOR UNLEARNED VIRGIN, WHEN THE SCHOOLS,
EMBOWELL'D OF THEIR DOCTRINE, HAVE LEFT OFF
THE DANGER TO ITSELF?
HELENA
THERE'S SOMETHING IN'T,
MORE THAN MY FATHER'S SKILL, WHICH WAS THE GREATEST
OF HIS PROFESSION, THAT HIS GOOD RECEIPT
SHALL FOR MY LEGACY BE SANCTIFIED
BY THE LUCKIEST STARS IN HEAVEN: AND, WOULD YOUR HONOUR
BUT GIVE ME LEAVE TO TRY SUCCESS, I'LD VENTURE
THE WELL-LOST LIFE OF MINE ON HIS GRACE'S CURE
BY SUCH A DAY AND HOUR.
COUNTESS
DOST THOU BELIEVE'T?
HELENA
AY, MADAM, KNOWINGLY.
COUNTESS
WHY, HELEN, THOU SHALT HAVE MY LEAVE AND LOVE,
MEANS AND ATTENDANTS AND MY LOVING GREETINGS
TO THOSE OF MINE IN COURT: I'LL STAY AT HOME
AND PRAY GOD'S BLESSING INTO THY ATTEMPT:
BE GONE TO-MORROW; AND BE SURE OF THIS,
WHAT I CAN HELP THEE TO THOU SHALT NOT MISS.

WHETHER I LIVE OR DIE, BE YOU THE SONS
OF WORTHY FRENCHMEN: LET HIGHER ITALY,--
THOSE BATED THAT INHERIT BUT THE FALL

THAT FAME MAY CRY YOU LOUD: I SAY, FAREWELL.
SECOND LORD
HEALTH, AT YOUR BIDDING, SERVE YOUR MAJESTY!
KING
THOSE GIRLS OF ITALY, TAKE HEED OF THEM:

I WOULD YOU HAD KNEEL'D, MY LORD, TO ASK ME MERCY,
AND THAT AT MY BIDDING YOU COULD SO STAND UP.
KING
I WOULD I HAD; SO I HAD BROKE THY PATE,
AND ASK'D THEE MERCY FOR'T.
LAFEU
GOOD FAITH, ACROSS: BUT, MY GOOD LORD 'TIS THUS;
WILL YOU BE CURED OF YOUR INFIRMITY?
KING
NO.
LAFEU
O, WILL YOU EAT NO GRAPES, MY ROYAL FOX?
YES, BUT YOU WILL MY NOBLE GRAPES, AN IF
MY ROYAL FOX COULD REACH THEM: I HAVE SEEN A MEDICINE
THAT'S ABLE TO BREATHE LIFE INTO A STONE,
QUICKEN A ROCK, AND MAKE YOU DANCE CANARY
WITH SPRITELY FIRE AND MOTION; WHOSE SIMPLE TOUCH,
IS POWERFUL TO ARAISE KING PEPIN, NAY,
TO GIVE GREAT CHARLEMAIN A PEN IN'S HAND,
AND WRITE TO HER A LOVE-LINE.
KING
WHAT 'HER' IS THIS?
LAFEU
WHY, DOCTOR SHE: MY LORD, THERE'S ONE ARRIVED,
IF YOU WILL SEE HER: NOW, BY MY FAITH AND HONOUR,
IF SERIOUSLY I MAY CONVEY MY THOUGHTS
IN THIS MY LIGHT DELIVERANCE, I HAVE SPOKE
WITH ONE THAT, IN HER SEX, HER YEARS, PROFESSION,
WISDOM AND CONSTANCY, HATH AMAZED ME MORE
THAN I DARE BLAME MY WEAKNESS: WILL YOU SEE HER
FOR THAT IS HER DEMAND, AND KNOW HER BUSINESS?
THAT DONE, LAUGH WELL AT ME.
KING
NOW, GOOD LAFEU,
BRING IN THE ADMIRATION; THAT WE WITH THEE

KING
NOW, FAIR ONE, DOES YOUR BUSINESS FOLLOW US?
HELENA
AY, MY GOOD LORD.
GERARD DE NARBON WAS MY FATHER;
IN WHAT HE DID PROFESS, WELL FOUND.
KING
I KNEW HIM.
HELENA
THE RATHER WILL I SPARE MY PRAISES TOWARDS HIM:
KNOWING HIM IS ENOUGH. ON'S BED OF DEATH
MANY RECEIPTS HE GAVE ME: CHIEFLY ONE.
WHICH, AS THE DEAREST ISSUE OF HIS PRACTISE,
AND OF HIS OLD EXPERIENCE THE OILY DARLING,
HE BADE ME STORE UP, AS A TRIPLE EYE,
SAFER THAN MINE OWN TWO, MORE DEAR; I HAVE SO;
AND HEARING YOUR HIGH MAJESTY IS TOUCH'D
WITH THAT MALIGNANT CAUSE WHEREIN THE HONOUR
OF MY DEAR FATHER'S GIFT STANDS CHIEF IN POWER,
I COME TO TENDER IT AND MY APPLIANCE
WITH ALL BOUND HUMBLENESS.
KING
WE THANK YOU, MAIDEN;
BUT MAY NOT BE SO CREDULOUS OF CURE,
WHEN OUR MOST LEARNED DOCTORS LEAVE US AND
THE CONGREGATED COLLEGE HAVE CONCLUDED
THAT LABOURING ART CAN NEVER RANSOM NATURE
FROM HER INAIDIBLE ESTATE; I SAY WE MUST NOT
SO STAIN OUR JUDGMENT, OR CORRUPT OUR HOPE,
TO PROSTITUTE OUR PAST-CURE MALADY
TO EMPIRICS, OR TO DISSEVER SO
OUR GREAT SELF AND OUR CREDIT, TO ESTEEM
A SENSELESS HELP WHEN HELP PAST SENSE WE DEEM.
HELENA
MY DUTY THEN SHALL PAY ME FOR MY PAINS:
I WILL NO MORE ENFORCE MINE OFFICE ON YOU.
HUMBLY ENTREATING FROM YOUR ROYAL THOUGHTS
A MODEST ONE, TO BEAR ME BACK AGAIN.
KING
I CANNOT GIVE THEE LESS, TO BE CALL'D GRATEFUL:
THOU THOUGHT'ST TO HELP ME; AND SUCH THANKS I GIVE
AS ONE NEAR DEATH TO THOSE THAT WISH HIM LIVE:
BUT WHAT AT FULL I KNOW, THOU KNOW'ST NO PART,
I KNOWING ALL MY PERIL, THOU NO ART.
HELENA
WHAT I CAN DO CAN DO NO HURT TO TRY,
SINCE YOU SET UP YOUR REST 'GAINST REMEDY.
HE THAT OF GREATEST WORKS IS FINISHER
OFT DOES THEM BY THE WEAKEST MINISTER:
SO HOLY WRIT IN BABES HATH JUDGMENT SHOWN,
WHEN JUDGES HAVE BEEN BABES; GREAT FLOODS HAVE FLOWN
FROM SIMPLE SOURCES, AND GREAT SEAS HAVE DRIED
WHEN MIRACLES HAVE BY THE GREATEST BEEN DENIED.
OFT EXPECTATION FAILS AND MOST OFT THERE
WHERE MOST IT PROMISES, AND OFT IT HITS
WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS.
KING
I MUST NOT HEAR THEE; FARE THEE WELL, KIND MAID;
THY PAINS NOT USED MUST BY THYSELF BE PAID:
PROFFERS NOT TOOK REAP THANKS FOR THEIR REWARD.
HELENA
INSPIRED MERIT SO BY BREATH IS BARR'D:
IT IS NOT SO WITH HIM THAT ALL THINGS KNOWS
AS 'TIS WITH US THAT SQUARE OUR GUESS BY SHOWS;
BUT MOST IT IS PRESUMPTION IN US WHEN
THE HELP OF HEAVEN WE COUNT THE ACT OF MEN.
DEAR SIR, TO MY ENDEAVOURS GIVE CONSENT;
OF HEAVEN, NOT ME, MAKE AN EXPERIMENT.
I AM NOT AN IMPOSTOR THAT PROCLAIM
MYSELF AGAINST THE LEVEL OF MINE AIM;
BUT KNOW I THINK AND THINK I KNOW MOST SURE
MY ART IS NOT PAST POWER NOR YOU PAST CURE.
KING
ARE THOU SO CONFIDENT? WITHIN WHAT SPACE
HOPEST THOU MY CURE?
HELENA
THE GREAT'ST GRACE LENDING GRACE
ERE TWICE THE HORSES OF THE SUN SHALL BRING
THEIR FIERY TORCHER HIS DIURNAL RING,
ERE TWICE IN MURK AND OCCIDENTAL DAMP
MOIST HESPERUS HATH QUENCH'D HIS SLEEPY LAMP,
OR FOUR AND TWENTY TIMES THE PILOT'S GLASS
HATH TOLD THE THIEVISH MINUTES HOW THEY PASS,
WHAT IS INFIRM FROM YOUR SOUND PARTS SHALL FLY,
HEALTH SHALL LIVE FREE AND SICKNESS FREELY DIE.
KING
UPON THY CERTAINTY AND CONFIDENCE
WHAT DAREST THOU VENTURE?
HELENA
TAX OF IMPUDENCE,
A STRUMPET'S BOLDNESS, A DIVULGED SHAME
TRADUCED BY ODIOUS BALLADS: MY MAIDEN'S NAME
SEAR'D OTHERWISE; NAY, WORSE--IF WORSE--EXTENDED
WITH VILEST TORTURE LET MY LIFE BE ENDED.
KING
METHINKS IN THEE SOME BLESSED SPIRIT DOTH SPEAK
HIS POWERFUL SOUND WITHIN AN ORGAN WEAK:
AND WHAT IMPOSSIBILITY WOULD SLAY
IN COMMON SENSE, SENSE SAVES ANOTHER WAY.
THY LIFE IS DEAR; FOR ALL THAT LIFE CAN RATE
WORTH NAME OF LIFE IN THEE HATH ESTIMATE,
YOUTH, BEAUTY, WISDOM, COURAGE, ALL
THAT HAPPINESS AND PRIME CAN HAPPY CALL:
THOU THIS TO HAZARD NEEDS MUST INTIMATE
SKILL INFINITE OR MONSTROUS DESPERATE.
SWEET PRACTISER, THY PHYSIC I WILL TRY,
THAT MINISTERS THINE OWN DEATH IF I DIE.
HELENA
IF I BREAK TIME, OR FLINCH IN PROPERTY
OF WHAT I SPOKE, UNPITIED LET ME DIE,
AND WELL DESERVED: NOT HELPING, DEATH'S MY FEE;
BUT, IF I HELP, WHAT DO YOU PROMISE ME?
KING
MAKE THY DEMAND.
HELENA
BUT WILL YOU MAKE IT EVEN?
KING
AY, BY MY SCEPTRE AND MY HOPES OF HEAVEN.
HELENA
THEN SHALT THOU GIVE ME WITH THY KINGLY HAND
WHAT HUSBAND IN THY POWER I WILL COMMAND:
EXEMPTED BE FROM ME THE ARROGANCE
TO CHOOSE FROM FORTH THE ROYAL BLOOD OF FRANCE,
MY LOW AND HUMBLE NAME TO PROPAGATE
WITH ANY BRANCH OR IMAGE OF THY STATE;
BUT SUCH A ONE, THY VASSAL, WHOM I KNOW
IS FREE FOR ME TO ASK, THEE TO BESTOW.
KING
HERE IS MY HAND; THE PREMISES OBSERVED,
THY WILL BY MY PERFORMANCE SHALL BE SERVED:
SO MAKE THE CHOICE OF THY OWN TIME, FOR I,
THY RESOLVED PATIENT, ON THEE STILL RELY.
MORE SHOULD I QUESTION THEE, AND MORE I MUST,
THOUGH MORE TO KNOW COULD NOT BE MORE TO TRUST,
FROM WHENCE THOU CAMEST, HOW TENDED ON: BUT REST
UNQUESTION'D WELCOME AND UNDOUBTED BLEST.
GIVE ME SOME HELP HERE, HO! IF THOU PROCEED
AS HIGH AS WORD, MY DEED SHALL MATCH THY MEED.

CLOWN
TRULY, MADAM, IF GOD HAVE LENT A MAN ANY MANNERS, HE

COUNTESS
IT MUST BE AN ANSWER OF MOST MONSTROUS SIZE THAT

BUT A TRIFLE NEITHER, IN GOOD FAITH, IF THE LEARNED
SHOULD SPEAK TRUTH OF IT: HERE IT IS, AND ALL THAT
BELONGS TO'T. ASK ME IF I AM A COURTIER: IT SHALL
DO YOU NO HARM TO LEARN.

O LORD, SIR! NAY, PUT ME TO'T, I WARRANT YOU.

DO YOU CRY, 'O LORD, SIR!' AT YOUR WHIPPING, AND
'SPARE NOT ME?' INDEED YOUR 'O LORD, SIR!' IS VERY

KING
THOU KNOW'ST SHE HAS RAISED ME FROM MY SICKLY BED.
BERTRAM

MUST ANSWER FOR YOUR RAISING? I KNOW HER WELL:

A POOR PHYSICIAN'S DAUGHTER MY WIFE! DISDAIN
RATHER CORRUPT ME EVER!
KING
'TIS ONLY TITLE THOU DISDAIN'ST IN HER, THE WHICH
I CAN BUILD UP. STRANGE IS IT THAT OUR BLOODS,
OF COLOUR, WEIGHT, AND HEAT, POUR'D ALL TOGETHER,

ALL THAT IS VIRTUOUS, SAVE WHAT THOU DISLIKEST,
A POOR PHYSICIAN'S DAUGHTER, THOU DISLIKEST
OF VIRTUE FOR THE NAME: BUT DO NOT SO:
FROM LOWEST PLACE WHEN VIRTUOUS THINGS PROCEED,
THE PLACE IS DIGNIFIED BY THE DOER'S DEED:
WHERE GREAT ADDITIONS SWELL'S, AND VIRTUE NONE,
IT IS A DROPSIED HONOUR. GOOD ALONE
IS GOOD WITHOUT A NAME. VILENESS IS SO:
THE PROPERTY BY WHAT IT IS SHOULD GO,
NOT BY THE TITLE. SHE IS YOUNG, WISE, FAIR;
IN THESE TO NATURE SHE'S IMMEDIATE HEIR,
AND THESE BREED HONOUR: THAT IS HONOUR'S SCORN,
WHICH CHALLENGES ITSELF AS HONOUR'S BORN
AND IS NOT LIKE THE SIRE: HONOURS THRIVE,
WHEN RATHER FROM OUR ACTS WE THEM DERIVE
THAN OUR FOREGOERS: THE MERE WORD'S A SLAVE
DEBOSH'D ON EVERY TOMB, ON EVERY GRAVE
A LYING TROPHY, AND AS OFT IS DUMB
WHERE DUST AND DAMN'D OBLIVION IS THE TOMB
OF HONOUR'D BONES INDEED. WHAT SHOULD BE SAID?
IF THOU CANST LIKE THIS CREATURE AS A MAID,
I CAN CREATE THE REST: VIRTUE AND SHE
IS HER OWN DOWER; HONOUR AND WEALTH FROM ME.

THAT DOST IN VILE MISPRISION SHACKLE UP
MY LOVE AND HER DESERT; THAT CANST NOT DREAM,
WE, POISING US IN HER DEFECTIVE SCALE,
SHALL WEIGH THEE TO THE BEAM; THAT WILT NOT KNOW,
IT IS IN US TO PLANT THINE HONOUR WHERE
WE PLEASE TO HAVE IT GROW. CHEQUE THY CONTEMPT:
OBEY OUR WILL, WHICH TRAVAILS IN THY GOOD:
BELIEVE NOT THY DISDAIN, BUT PRESENTLY
DO THINE OWN FORTUNES THAT OBEDIENT RIGHT
WHICH BOTH THY DUTY OWES AND OUR POWER CLAIMS;
OR I WILL THROW THEE FROM MY CARE FOR EVER
INTO THE STAGGERS AND THE CARELESS LAPSE
OF YOUTH AND IGNORANCE; BOTH MY REVENGE AND HATE
LOOSING UPON THEE, IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE,
WITHOUT ALL TERMS OF PITY. SPEAK; THINE ANSWER.

PARDON, MY GRACIOUS LORD; FOR I SUBMIT
MY FANCY TO YOUR EYES: WHEN I CONSIDER
WHAT GREAT CREATION AND WHAT DOLE OF HONOUR
FLIES WHERE YOU BID IT, I FIND THAT SHE, WHICH LATE
WAS IN MY NOBLER THOUGHTS MOST BASE, IS NOW
THE PRAISED OF THE KING; WHO, SO ENNOBLED,
IS AS 'TWERE BORN SO.

AY, MARRY, IS'T.
A MARCH AFAR

HARK YOU! THEY COME THIS WAY.
IF YOU WILL TARRY, HOLY PILGRIM,
BUT TILL THE TROOPS COME BY,
I WILL CONDUCT YOU WHERE YOU SHALL BE LODGED;
THE RATHER, FOR I THINK I KNOW YOUR HOSTESS
AS AMPLE AS MYSELF.
HELENA
IS IT YOURSELF?
WIDOW
IF YOU SHALL PLEASE SO, PILGRIM.
HELENA
I THANK YOU, AND WILL STAY UPON YOUR LEISURE.
WIDOW
YOU CAME, I THINK, FROM FRANCE?
HELENA
I DID SO.
WIDOW
HERE YOU SHALL SEE A COUNTRYMAN OF YOURS
THAT HAS DONE WORTHY SERVICE.
HELENA
HIS NAME, I PRAY YOU.
DIANA
THE COUNT ROUSILLON: KNOW YOU SUCH A ONE?
HELENA
BUT BY THE EAR, THAT HEARS MOST NOBLY OF HIM:
HIS FACE I KNOW NOT.
DIANA
WHATSOME'ER HE IS,
HE'S BRAVELY TAKEN HERE. HE STOLE FROM FRANCE,
AS 'TIS REPORTED, FOR THE KING HAD MARRIED HIM
AGAINST HIS LIKING: THINK YOU IT IS SO?
HELENA
AY, SURELY, MERE THE TRUTH: I KNOW HIS LADY.
DIANA
THERE IS A GENTLEMAN THAT SERVES THE COUNT
REPORTS BUT COARSELY OF HER.
HELENA
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
DIANA
MONSIEUR PAROLLES.
HELENA
O, I BELIEVE WITH HIM,
IN ARGUMENT OF PRAISE, OR TO THE WORTH
OF THE GREAT COUNT HIMSELF, SHE IS TOO MEAN
TO HAVE HER NAME REPEATED: ALL HER DESERVING
IS A RESERVED HONESTY, AND THAT
I HAVE NOT HEARD EXAMINED.
DIANA
ALAS, POOR LADY!
'TIS A HARD BONDAGE TO BECOME THE WIFE
OF A DETESTING LORD.
WIDOW
I WARRANT, GOOD CREATURE, WHERESOE'ER SHE IS,
HER HEART WEIGHS SADLY: THIS YOUNG MAID MIGHT DO HER
A SHREWD TURN, IF SHE PLEASED.
HELENA
HOW DO YOU MEAN?
MAY BE THE AMOROUS COUNT SOLICITS HER
IN THE UNLAWFUL PURPOSE.
WIDOW
HE DOES INDEED;
AND BROKES WITH ALL THAT CAN IN SUCH A SUIT
CORRUPT THE TENDER HONOUR OF A MAID:
BUT SHE IS ARM'D FOR HIM AND KEEPS HER GUARD
IN HONESTEST DEFENCE.
MARIANA
THE GODS FORBID ELSE!
WIDOW
SO, NOW THEY COME:
DRUM AND COLOURS

ENTER BERTRAM, PAROLLES, AND THE WHOLE ARMY

THAT IS ANTONIO, THE DUKE'S ELDEST SON;
THAT, ESCALUS.
HELENA
WHICH IS THE FRENCHMAN?
DIANA
HE;
THAT WITH THE PLUME: 'TIS A MOST GALLANT FELLOW.
I WOULD HE LOVED HIS WIFE: IF HE WERE HONESTER
HE WERE MUCH GOODLIER: IS'T NOT A HANDSOME GENTLEMAN?
HELENA
I LIKE HIM WELL.
DIANA
'TIS PITY HE IS NOT HONEST: YOND'S THAT SAME KNAVE
THAT LEADS HIM TO THESE PLACES: WERE I HIS LADY,
I WOULD POISON THAT VILE RASCAL.
HELENA
WHICH IS HE?
DIANA
THAT JACK-AN-APES WITH SCARFS: WHY IS HE MELANCHOLY?
HELENA
PERCHANCE HE'S HURT I' THE BATTLE.
PAROLLES
LOSE OUR DRUM! WELL.
MARIANA
HE'S SHREWDLY VEXED AT SOMETHING: LOOK, HE HAS SPIED US.
WIDOW
MARRY, HANG YOU!
MARIANA
AND YOUR COURTESY, FOR A RING-CARRIER!
EXEUNT BERTRAM, PAROLLES, AND ARMY

WIDOW
THE TROOP IS PAST. COME, PILGRIM, I WILL BRING YOU
WHERE YOU SHALL HOST: OF ENJOIN'D PENITENTS
THERE'S FOUR OR FIVE, TO GREAT SAINT JAQUES BOUND,
ALREADY AT MY HOUSE.
HELENA
I HUMBLY THANK YOU:
PLEASE IT THIS MATRON AND THIS GENTLE MAID
TO EAT WITH US TO-NIGHT, THE CHARGE AND THANKING
SHALL BE FOR ME; AND, TO REQUITE YOU FURTHER,
I WILL BESTOW SOME PRECEPTS OF THIS VIRGIN
WORTHY THE NOTE.
BOTH
WE'LL TAKE YOUR OFFER KINDLY.

SCENE VI. CAMP BEFORE FLORENCE.

ENTER BERTRAM AND THE TWO FRENCH LORDS
SECOND LORD
NAY, GOOD MY LORD, PUT HIM TO'T; LET HIM HAVE HIS
WAY.
FIRST LORD
IF YOUR LORDSHIP FIND HIM NOT A HILDING, HOLD ME NO
MORE IN YOUR RESPECT.
SECOND LORD
ON MY LIFE, MY LORD, A BUBBLE.
BERTRAM
DO YOU THINK I AM SO FAR DECEIVED IN HIM?
SECOND LORD
BELIEVE IT, MY LORD, IN MINE OWN DIRECT KNOWLEDGE,
WITHOUT ANY MALICE, BUT TO SPEAK OF HIM AS MY
KINSMAN, HE'S A MOST NOTABLE COWARD, AN INFINITE AND
ENDLESS LIAR, AN HOURLY PROMISE-BREAKER, THE OWNER
OF NO ONE GOOD QUALITY WORTHY YOUR LORDSHIP'S
ENTERTAINMENT.
FIRST LORD
IT WERE FIT YOU KNEW HIM; LEST, REPOSING TOO FAR IN
HIS VIRTUE, WHICH HE HATH NOT, HE MIGHT AT SOME
GREAT AND TRUSTY BUSINESS IN A MAIN DANGER FAIL YOU.
BERTRAM
I WOULD I KNEW IN WHAT PARTICULAR ACTION TO TRY HIM.
FIRST LORD
NONE BETTER THAN TO LET HIM FETCH OFF HIS DRUM,
WHICH YOU HEAR HIM SO CONFIDENTLY UNDERTAKE TO DO.
SECOND LORD
I, WITH A TROOP OF FLORENTINES, WILL SUDDENLY
SURPRISE HIM; SUCH I WILL HAVE, WHOM I AM SURE HE
KNOWS NOT FROM THE ENEMY: WE WILL BIND AND HOODWINK
HIM SO, THAT HE SHALL SUPPOSE NO OTHER BUT THAT HE
IS CARRIED INTO THE LEAGUER OF THE ADVERSARIES, WHEN
WE BRING HIM TO OUR OWN TENTS. BE BUT YOUR LORDSHIP
PRESENT AT HIS EXAMINATION: IF HE DO NOT, FOR THE
PROMISE OF HIS LIFE AND IN THE HIGHEST COMPULSION OF
BASE FEAR, OFFER TO BETRAY YOU AND DELIVER ALL THE
INTELLIGENCE IN HIS POWER AGAINST YOU, AND THAT WITH
THE DIVINE FORFEIT OF HIS SOUL UPON OATH, NEVER
TRUST MY JUDGMENT IN ANY THING.
FIRST LORD
O, FOR THE LOVE OF LAUGHTER, LET HIM FETCH HIS DRUM;
HE SAYS HE HAS A STRATAGEM FOR'T: WHEN YOUR
LORDSHIP SEES THE BOTTOM OF HIS SUCCESS IN'T, AND TO
WHAT METAL THIS COUNTERFEIT LUMP OF ORE WILL BE
MELTED, IF YOU GIVE HIM NOT JOHN DRUM'S
ENTERTAINMENT, YOUR INCLINING CANNOT BE REMOVED.
HERE HE COMES.
ENTER PAROLLES

SECOND LORD
[ASIDE TO BERTRAM] O, FOR THE LOVE OF LAUGHTER,
HINDER NOT THE HONOUR OF HIS DESIGN: LET HIM FETCH
OFF HIS DRUM IN ANY HAND.
BERTRAM
HOW NOW, MONSIEUR! THIS DRUM STICKS SORELY IN YOUR
DISPOSITION.
FIRST LORD
A POX ON'T, LET IT GO; 'TIS BUT A DRUM.
PAROLLES
'BUT A DRUM'! IS'T 'BUT A DRUM'? A DRUM SO LOST!
THERE WAS EXCELLENT COMMAND,--TO CHARGE IN WITH OUR
HORSE UPON OUR OWN WINGS, AND TO REND OUR OWN SOLDIERS!
FIRST LORD
THAT WAS NOT TO BE BLAMED IN THE COMMAND OF THE
SERVICE: IT WAS A DISASTER OF WAR THAT CAESAR
HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED, IF HE HAD BEEN
THERE TO COMMAND.
BERTRAM
WELL, WE CANNOT GREATLY CONDEMN OUR SUCCESS: SOME
DISHONOUR WE HAD IN THE LOSS OF THAT DRUM; BUT IT IS
NOT TO BE RECOVERED.
PAROLLES
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.
BERTRAM
IT MIGHT; BUT IT IS NOT NOW.
PAROLLES
IT IS TO BE RECOVERED: BUT THAT THE MERIT OF
SERVICE IS SELDOM ATTRIBUTED TO THE TRUE AND EXACT
PERFORMER, I WOULD HAVE THAT DRUM OR ANOTHER, OR
'HIC JACET.'
BERTRAM
WHY, IF YOU HAVE A STOMACH, TO'T, MONSIEUR: IF YOU
THINK YOUR MYSTERY IN STRATAGEM CAN BRING THIS
INSTRUMENT OF HONOUR AGAIN INTO HIS NATIVE QUARTER,
BE MAGNANIMOUS IN THE ENTERPRISE AND GO ON; I WILL
GRACE THE ATTEMPT FOR A WORTHY EXPLOIT: IF YOU
SPEED WELL IN IT, THE DUKE SHALL BOTH SPEAK OF IT.
AND EXTEND TO YOU WHAT FURTHER BECOMES HIS
GREATNESS, EVEN TO THE UTMOST SYLLABLE OF YOUR
WORTHINESS.
PAROLLES
BY THE HAND OF A SOLDIER, I WILL UNDERTAKE IT.
BERTRAM
BUT YOU MUST NOT NOW SLUMBER IN IT.
PAROLLES
I'LL ABOUT IT THIS EVENING: AND I WILL PRESENTLY
PEN DOWN MY DILEMMAS, ENCOURAGE MYSELF IN MY
CERTAINTY, PUT MYSELF INTO MY MORTAL PREPARATION;
AND BY MIDNIGHT LOOK TO HEAR FURTHER FROM ME.
BERTRAM
MAY I BE BOLD TO ACQUAINT HIS GRACE YOU ARE GONE ABOUT IT?
PAROLLES
I KNOW NOT WHAT THE SUCCESS WILL BE, MY LORD; BUT
THE ATTEMPT I VOW.
BERTRAM
I KNOW THOU'RT VALIANT; AND, TO THE POSSIBILITY OF
THY SOLDIERSHIP, WILL SUBSCRIBE FOR THEE. FAREWELL.
PAROLLES
I LOVE NOT MANY WORDS.
EXIT

SECOND LORD
NO MORE THAN A FISH LOVES WATER. IS NOT THIS A
STRANGE FELLOW, MY LORD, THAT SO CONFIDENTLY SEEMS
TO UNDERTAKE THIS BUSINESS, WHICH HE KNOWS IS NOT TO
BE DONE; DAMNS HIMSELF TO DO AND DARES BETTER BE
DAMNED THAN TO DO'T?
FIRST LORD
YOU DO NOT KNOW HIM, MY LORD, AS WE DO: CERTAIN IT
IS THAT HE WILL STEAL HIMSELF INTO A MAN'S FAVOUR AND
FOR A WEEK ESCAPE A GREAT DEAL OF DISCOVERIES; BUT
WHEN YOU FIND HIM OUT, YOU HAVE HIM EVER AFTER.
BERTRAM
WHY, DO YOU THINK HE WILL MAKE NO DEED AT ALL OF
THIS THAT SO SERIOUSLY HE DOES ADDRESS HIMSELF UNTO?
SECOND LORD
NONE IN THE WORLD; BUT RETURN WITH AN INVENTION AND
CLAP UPON YOU TWO OR THREE PROBABLE LIES: BUT WE
HAVE ALMOST EMBOSSED HIM; YOU SHALL SEE HIS FALL
TO-NIGHT; FOR INDEED HE IS NOT FOR YOUR LORDSHIP'S RESPECT.
FIRST LORD
WE'LL MAKE YOU SOME SPORT WITH THE FOX ERE WE CASE
HIM. HE WAS FIRST SMOKED BY THE OLD LORD LAFEU:
WHEN HIS DISGUISE AND HE IS PARTED, TELL ME WHAT A
SPRAT YOU SHALL FIND HIM; WHICH YOU SHALL SEE THIS
VERY NIGHT.
SECOND LORD
I MUST GO LOOK MY TWIGS: HE SHALL BE CAUGHT.
BERTRAM
YOUR BROTHER HE SHALL GO ALONG WITH ME.
SECOND LORD
AS'T PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP: I'LL LEAVE YOU.
EXIT

BERTRAM
NOW WILL I LEAD YOU TO THE HOUSE, AND SHOW YOU
THE LASS I SPOKE OF.
FIRST LORD
BUT YOU SAY SHE'S HONEST.
BERTRAM
THAT'S ALL THE FAULT: I SPOKE WITH HER BUT ONCE
AND FOUND HER WONDROUS COLD; BUT I SENT TO HER,
BY THIS SAME COXCOMB THAT WE HAVE I' THE WIND,
TOKENS AND LETTERS WHICH SHE DID RE-SEND;
AND THIS IS ALL I HAVE DONE. SHE'S A FAIR CREATURE:
WILL YOU GO SEE HER?
FIRST LORD
WITH ALL MY HEART, MY LORD.

WIDOW
THOUGH MY ESTATE BE FALLEN, I WAS WELL BORN,
NOTHING ACQUAINTED WITH THESE BUSINESSES;
AND WOULD NOT PUT MY REPUTATION NOW
IN ANY STAINING ACT.
HELENA
NOR WOULD I WISH YOU.
FIRST, GIVE ME TRUST, THE COUNT HE IS MY HUSBAND,
AND WHAT TO YOUR SWORN COUNSEL I HAVE SPOKEN
IS SO FROM WORD TO WORD; AND THEN YOU CANNOT,
BY THE GOOD AID THAT I OF YOU SHALL BORROW,
ERR IN BESTOWING IT.
WIDOW
I SHOULD BELIEVE YOU:
FOR YOU HAVE SHOW'D ME THAT WHICH WELL APPROVES
YOU'RE GREAT IN FORTUNE.
HELENA
TAKE THIS PURSE OF GOLD,
AND LET ME BUY YOUR FRIENDLY HELP THUS FAR,
WHICH I WILL OVER-PAY AND PAY AGAIN
WHEN I HAVE FOUND IT. THE COUNT HE WOOES YOUR DAUGHTER,
LAYS DOWN HIS WANTON SIEGE BEFORE HER BEAUTY,
RESOLVED TO CARRY HER: LET HER IN FINE CONSENT,
AS WE'LL DIRECT HER HOW 'TIS BEST TO BEAR IT.
NOW HIS IMPORTANT BLOOD WILL NOUGHT DENY
THAT SHE'LL DEMAND: A RING THE COUNTY WEARS,
THAT DOWNWARD HATH SUCCEEDED IN HIS HOUSE
FROM SON TO SON, SOME FOUR OR FIVE DESCENTS
SINCE THE FIRST FATHER WORE IT: THIS RING HE HOLDS
IN MOST RICH CHOICE; YET IN HIS IDLE FIRE,
TO BUY HIS WILL, IT WOULD NOT SEEM TOO DEAR,
HOWE'ER REPENTED AFTER.
WIDOW
NOW I SEE
THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PURPOSE.
HELENA
YOU SEE IT LAWFUL, THEN: IT IS NO MORE,
BUT THAT YOUR DAUGHTER, ERE SHE SEEMS AS WON,
DESIRES THIS RING; APPOINTS HIM AN ENCOUNTER;
IN FINE, DELIVERS ME TO FILL THE TIME,
HERSELF MOST CHASTELY ABSENT: AFTER THIS,
TO MARRY HER, I'LL ADD THREE THOUSAND CROWNS
TO WHAT IS PASSED ALREADY.
WIDOW
I HAVE YIELDED:
INSTRUCT MY DAUGHTER HOW SHE SHALL PERSEVER,
THAT TIME AND PLACE WITH THIS DECEIT SO LAWFUL
MAY PROVE COHERENT. EVERY NIGHT HE COMES
WITH MUSICS OF ALL SORTS AND SONGS COMPOSED
TO HER UNWORTHINESS: IT NOTHING STEADS US
TO CHIDE HIM FROM OUR EAVES; FOR HE PERSISTS
AS IF HIS LIFE LAY ON'T.
HELENA
WHY THEN TO-NIGHT
LET US ASSAY OUR PLOT; WHICH, IF IT SPEED,
IS WICKED MEANING IN A LAWFUL DEED
AND LAWFUL MEANING IN A LAWFUL ACT,
WHERE BOTH NOT SIN, AND YET A SINFUL FACT:
BUT LET'S ABOUT IT.

FIRST SOLDIER

BUT WHAT LINSEY-WOOLSEY HAST THOU TO SPEAK TO US AGAIN?
FIRST SOLDIER
E'EN SUCH AS YOU SPEAK TO ME.
SECOND LORD
HE MUST THINK US SOME BAND OF STRANGERS I' THE

SPEAK ONE TO ANOTHER; SO WE SEEM TO KNOW, IS TO
KNOW STRAIGHT OUR PURPOSE: CHOUGHS' LANGUAGE,
GABBLE ENOUGH, AND GOOD ENOUGH. AS FOR YOU,

MY TONGUE IS TOO FOOLHARDY; BUT MY HEART HATH THE
FEAR OF MARS BEFORE IT AND OF HIS CREATURES, NOT
DARING THE REPORTS OF MY TONGUE.
SECOND LORD

WAS GUILTY OF.
PAROLLES
WHAT THE DEVIL SHOULD MOVE ME TO UNDERTAKE THE
RECOVERY OF THIS DRUM, BEING NOT IGNORANT OF THE
IMPOSSIBILITY, AND KNOWING I HAD NO SUCH PURPOSE? I

ONES I DARE NOT GIVE. WHEREFORE, WHAT'S THE
INSTANCE? TONGUE, I MUST PUT YOU INTO A
BUTTER-WOMAN'S MOUTH AND BUY MYSELF ANOTHER OF
BAJAZET'S MULE, IF YOU PRATTLE ME INTO THESE PERILS.
SECOND LORD

TITLED GODDESS;
AND WORTH IT, WITH ADDITION! BUT, FAIR SOUL,
IN YOUR FINE FRAME HATH LOVE NO QUALITY?
IF QUICK FIRE OF YOUTH LIGHT NOT YOUR MIND,
YOU ARE NO MAIDEN, BUT A MONUMENT:
WHEN YOU ARE DEAD, YOU SHOULD BE SUCH A ONE
AS YOU ARE NOW, FOR YOU ARE COLD AND STEM;
AND NOW YOU SHOULD BE AS YOUR MOTHER WAS
WHEN YOUR SWEET SELF WAS GOT.

I LOVED YOU DEARLY, WOULD YOU BELIEVE MY OATHS,
WHEN I DID LOVE YOU ILL? THIS HAS NO HOLDING,

ARE WORDS AND POOR CONDITIONS, BUT UNSEAL'D,
AT LEAST IN MY OPINION.

BE NOT SO HOLY-CRUEL: LOVE IS HOLY;

MY REASONS ARE MOST STRONG; AND YOU SHALL KNOW THEM
WHEN BACK AGAIN THIS RING SHALL BE DELIVER'D:
AND ON YOUR FINGER IN THE NIGHT I'LL PUT

SCENE III. THE FLORENTINE CAMP.

ENTER THE TWO FRENCH LORDS AND SOME TWO OR THREE SOLDIERS
FIRST LORD
YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN HIM HIS MOTHER'S LETTER?
SECOND LORD
I HAVE DELIVERED IT AN HOUR SINCE: THERE IS
SOMETHING IN'T THAT STINGS HIS NATURE; FOR ON THE
READING IT HE CHANGED ALMOST INTO ANOTHER MAN.
FIRST LORD
HE HAS MUCH WORTHY BLAME LAID UPON HIM FOR SHAKING
OFF SO GOOD A WIFE AND SO SWEET A LADY.
SECOND LORD
ESPECIALLY HE HATH INCURRED THE EVERLASTING
DISPLEASURE OF THE KING, WHO HAD EVEN TUNED HIS
BOUNTY TO SING HAPPINESS TO HIM. I WILL TELL YOU A
THING, BUT YOU SHALL LET IT DWELL DARKLY WITH YOU.
FIRST LORD
WHEN YOU HAVE SPOKEN IT, 'TIS DEAD, AND I AM THE
GRAVE OF IT.
SECOND LORD
HE HATH PERVERTED A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN HERE IN
FLORENCE, OF A MOST CHASTE RENOWN; AND THIS NIGHT HE
FLESHES HIS WILL IN THE SPOIL OF HER HONOUR: HE HATH
GIVEN HER HIS MONUMENTAL RING, AND THINKS HIMSELF
MADE IN THE UNCHASTE COMPOSITION.
FIRST LORD
NOW, GOD DELAY OUR REBELLION! AS WE ARE OURSELVES,
WHAT THINGS ARE WE!
SECOND LORD
MERELY OUR OWN TRAITORS. AND AS IN THE COMMON COURSE
OF ALL TREASONS, WE STILL SEE THEM REVEAL
THEMSELVES, TILL THEY ATTAIN TO THEIR ABHORRED ENDS,
SO HE THAT IN THIS ACTION CONTRIVES AGAINST HIS OWN
NOBILITY, IN HIS PROPER STREAM O'ERFLOWS HIMSELF.
FIRST LORD
IS IT NOT MEANT DAMNABLE IN US, TO BE TRUMPETERS OF
OUR UNLAWFUL INTENTS? WE SHALL NOT THEN HAVE HIS
COMPANY TO-NIGHT?
SECOND LORD
NOT TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT; FOR HE IS DIETED TO HIS HOUR.
FIRST LORD
THAT APPROACHES APACE; I WOULD GLADLY HAVE HIM SEE
HIS COMPANY ANATOMIZED, THAT HE MIGHT TAKE A MEASURE
OF HIS OWN JUDGMENTS, WHEREIN SO CURIOUSLY HE HAD
SET THIS COUNTERFEIT.
SECOND LORD
WE WILL NOT MEDDLE WITH HIM TILL HE COME; FOR HIS
PRESENCE MUST BE THE WHIP OF THE OTHER.
FIRST LORD
IN THE MEAN TIME, WHAT HEAR YOU OF THESE WARS?
SECOND LORD
I HEAR THERE IS AN OVERTURE OF PEACE.
FIRST LORD
NAY, I ASSURE YOU, A PEACE CONCLUDED.
SECOND LORD
WHAT WILL COUNT ROUSILLON DO THEN? WILL HE TRAVEL
HIGHER, OR RETURN AGAIN INTO FRANCE?
FIRST LORD
I PERCEIVE, BY THIS DEMAND, YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER
OF HIS COUNCIL.
SECOND LORD
LET IT BE FORBID, SIR; SO SHOULD I BE A GREAT DEAL
OF HIS ACT.
FIRST LORD
SIR, HIS WIFE SOME TWO MONTHS SINCE FLED FROM HIS
HOUSE: HER PRETENCE IS A PILGRIMAGE TO SAINT JAQUES
LE GRAND; WHICH HOLY UNDERTAKING WITH MOST AUSTERE
SANCTIMONY SHE ACCOMPLISHED; AND, THERE RESIDING THE
TENDERNESS OF HER NATURE BECAME AS A PREY TO HER
GRIEF; IN FINE, MADE A GROAN OF HER LAST BREATH, AND
NOW SHE SINGS IN HEAVEN.
SECOND LORD
HOW IS THIS JUSTIFIED?
FIRST LORD
THE STRONGER PART OF IT BY HER OWN LETTERS, WHICH
MAKES HER STORY TRUE, EVEN TO THE POINT OF HER
DEATH: HER DEATH ITSELF, WHICH COULD NOT BE HER
OFFICE TO SAY IS COME, WAS FAITHFULLY CONFIRMED BY
THE RECTOR OF THE PLACE.
SECOND LORD
HATH THE COUNT ALL THIS INTELLIGENCE?
FIRST LORD
AY, AND THE PARTICULAR CONFIRMATIONS, POINT FROM
POINT, SO TO THE FULL ARMING OF THE VERITY.
SECOND LORD
I AM HEARTILY SORRY THAT HE'LL BE GLAD OF THIS.
FIRST LORD
HOW MIGHTILY SOMETIMES WE MAKE US COMFORTS OF OUR LOSSES!
SECOND LORD
AND HOW MIGHTILY SOME OTHER TIMES WE DROWN OUR GAIN
IN TEARS! THE GREAT DIGNITY THAT HIS VALOUR HATH
HERE ACQUIRED FOR HIM SHALL AT HOME BE ENCOUNTERED
WITH A SHAME AS AMPLE.
FIRST LORD
THE WEB OF OUR LIFE IS OF A MINGLED YARN, GOOD AND
ILL TOGETHER: OUR VIRTUES WOULD BE PROUD, IF OUR
FAULTS WHIPPED THEM NOT; AND OUR CRIMES WOULD
DESPAIR, IF THEY WERE NOT CHERISHED BY OUR VIRTUES.

HOW NOW, MY LORD! IS'T NOT AFTER MIDNIGHT?

I HAVE CONGIED WITH THE DUKE, DONE MY ADIEU WITH HIS
NEAREST; BURIED A WIFE, MOURNED FOR HER; WRIT TO MY
LADY MOTHER I AM RETURNING; ENTERTAINED MY CONVOY;
AND BETWEEN THESE MAIN PARCELS OF DISPATCH EFFECTED
MANY NICER NEEDS; THE LAST WAS THE GREATEST, BUT
THAT I HAVE NOT ENDED YET.
SECOND LORD
IF THE BUSINESS BE OF ANY DIFFICULTY, AND THIS
MORNING YOUR DEPARTURE HENCE, IT REQUIRES HASTE OF
YOUR LORDSHIP.
BERTRAM
I MEAN, THE BUSINESS IS NOT ENDED, AS FEARING TO
HEAR OF IT HEREAFTER. BUT SHALL WE HAVE THIS
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE FOOL AND THE SOLDIER? COME,
BRING FORTH THIS COUNTERFEIT MODULE, HE HAS DECEIVED
ME, LIKE A DOUBLE-MEANING PROPHESIER.
SECOND LORD
BRING HIM FORTH: HAS SAT I' THE STOCKS ALL NIGHT,
POOR GALLANT KNAVE.
BERTRAM
NO MATTER: HIS HEELS HAVE DESERVED IT, IN USURPING
HIS SPURS SO LONG. HOW DOES HE CARRY HIMSELF?
SECOND LORD
I HAVE TOLD YOUR LORDSHIP ALREADY, THE STOCKS CARRY
HIM. BUT TO ANSWER YOU AS YOU WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD;
HE WEEPS LIKE A WENCH THAT HAD SHED HER MILK: HE
HATH CONFESSED HIMSELF TO MORGAN, WHOM HE SUPPOSES
TO BE A FRIAR, FROM THE TIME OF HIS REMEMBRANCE TO
THIS VERY INSTANT DISASTER OF HIS SETTING I' THE
STOCKS: AND WHAT THINK YOU HE HATH CONFESSED?
BERTRAM
NOTHING OF ME, HAS A'?
SECOND LORD
HIS CONFESSION IS TAKEN, AND IT SHALL BE READ TO HIS
FACE: IF YOUR LORDSHIP BE IN'T, AS I BELIEVE YOU
ARE, YOU MUST HAVE THE PATIENCE TO HEAR IT.
ENTER PAROLLES GUARDED, AND FIRST SOLDIER

BERTRAM
A PLAGUE UPON HIM! MUFFLED! HE CAN SAY NOTHING OF
ME: HUSH, HUSH!
FIRST LORD
HOODMAN COMES! PORTOTARTAROSA
FIRST SOLDIER
HE CALLS FOR THE TORTURES: WHAT WILL YOU SAY
WITHOUT 'EM?
PAROLLES
I WILL CONFESS WHAT I KNOW WITHOUT CONSTRAINT: IF
YE PINCH ME LIKE A PASTY, I CAN SAY NO MORE.
FIRST SOLDIER
BOSKO CHIMURCHO.
FIRST LORD
BOBLIBINDO CHICURMURCO.
FIRST SOLDIER
YOU ARE A MERCIFUL GENERAL. OUR GENERAL BIDS YOU
ANSWER TO WHAT I SHALL ASK YOU OUT OF A NOTE.
PAROLLES
AND TRULY, AS I HOPE TO LIVE.
FIRST SOLDIER
[READS] 'FIRST DEMAND OF HIM HOW MANY HORSE THE
DUKE IS STRONG.' WHAT SAY YOU TO THAT?
PAROLLES
FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND; BUT VERY WEAK AND
UNSERVICEABLE: THE TROOPS ARE ALL SCATTERED, AND
THE COMMANDERS VERY POOR ROGUES, UPON MY REPUTATION
AND CREDIT AND AS I HOPE TO LIVE.
FIRST SOLDIER
SHALL I SET DOWN YOUR ANSWER SO?
PAROLLES
DO: I'LL TAKE THE SACRAMENT ON'T, HOW AND WHICH WAY YOU WILL.
BERTRAM
ALL'S ONE TO HIM. WHAT A PAST-SAVING SLAVE IS THIS!
FIRST LORD
YOU'RE DECEIVED, MY LORD: THIS IS MONSIEUR
PAROLLES, THE GALLANT MILITARIST,--THAT WAS HIS OWN
PHRASE,--THAT HAD THE WHOLE THEORIC OF WAR IN THE
KNOT OF HIS SCARF, AND THE PRACTISE IN THE CHAPE OF
HIS DAGGER.
SECOND LORD
I WILL NEVER TRUST A MAN AGAIN FOR KEEPING HIS SWORD
CLEAN. NOR BELIEVE HE CAN HAVE EVERY THING IN HIM
BY WEARING HIS APPAREL NEATLY.
FIRST SOLDIER
WELL, THAT'S SET DOWN.
PAROLLES
FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND HORSE, I SAID,-- I WILL SAY
TRUE,--OR THEREABOUTS, SET DOWN, FOR I'LL SPEAK TRUTH.
FIRST LORD
HE'S VERY NEAR THE TRUTH IN THIS.
BERTRAM
BUT I CON HIM NO THANKS FOR'T, IN THE NATURE HE
DELIVERS IT.
PAROLLES
POOR ROGUES, I PRAY YOU, SAY.
FIRST SOLDIER
WELL, THAT'S SET DOWN.
PAROLLES
I HUMBLY THANK YOU, SIR: A TRUTH'S A TRUTH, THE
ROGUES ARE MARVELLOUS POOR.
FIRST SOLDIER
[READS] 'DEMAND OF HIM, OF WHAT STRENGTH THEY ARE
A-FOOT.' WHAT SAY YOU TO THAT?
PAROLLES
BY MY TROTH, SIR, IF I WERE TO LIVE THIS PRESENT
HOUR, I WILL TELL TRUE. LET ME SEE: SPURIO, A
HUNDRED AND FIFTY; SEBASTIAN, SO MANY; CORAMBUS, SO
MANY; JAQUES, SO MANY; GUILTIAN, COSMO, LODOWICK,
AND GRATII, TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EACH; MINE OWN
COMPANY, CHITOPHER, VAUMOND, BENTII, TWO HUNDRED AND
FIFTY EACH: SO THAT THE MUSTER-FILE, ROTTEN AND
SOUND, UPON MY LIFE, AMOUNTS NOT TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND
POLL; HALF OF THE WHICH DARE NOT SHAKE SNOW FROM OFF
THEIR CASSOCKS, LEST THEY SHAKE THEMSELVES TO PIECES.
BERTRAM
WHAT SHALL BE DONE TO HIM?
FIRST LORD
NOTHING, BUT LET HIM HAVE THANKS. DEMAND OF HIM MY
CONDITION, AND WHAT CREDIT I HAVE WITH THE DUKE.
FIRST SOLDIER
WELL, THAT'S SET DOWN.
READS

'YOU SHALL DEMAND OF HIM, WHETHER ONE CAPTAIN DUMAIN
BE I' THE CAMP, A FRENCHMAN; WHAT HIS REPUTATION IS
WITH THE DUKE; WHAT HIS VALOUR, HONESTY, AND
EXPERTNESS IN WARS; OR WHETHER HE THINKS IT WERE NOT
POSSIBLE, WITH WELL-WEIGHING SUMS OF GOLD, TO
CORRUPT HIM TO REVOLT.' WHAT SAY YOU TO THIS? WHAT
DO YOU KNOW OF IT?
PAROLLES
I BESEECH YOU, LET ME ANSWER TO THE PARTICULAR OF
THE INTER'GATORIES: DEMAND THEM SINGLY.
FIRST SOLDIER
DO YOU KNOW THIS CAPTAIN DUMAIN?
PAROLLES
I KNOW HIM: A' WAS A BOTCHER'S 'PRENTICE IN PARIS,
FROM WHENCE HE WAS WHIPPED FOR GETTING THE SHRIEVE'S
FOOL WITH CHILD,--A DUMB INNOCENT, THAT COULD NOT
SAY HIM NAY.
BERTRAM
NAY, BY YOUR LEAVE, HOLD YOUR HANDS; THOUGH I KNOW
HIS BRAINS ARE FORFEIT TO THE NEXT TILE THAT FALLS.
FIRST SOLDIER
WELL, IS THIS CAPTAIN IN THE DUKE OF FLORENCE'S CAMP?
PAROLLES
UPON MY KNOWLEDGE, HE IS, AND LOUSY.
FIRST LORD
NAY LOOK NOT SO UPON ME; WE SHALL HEAR OF YOUR
LORDSHIP ANON.
FIRST SOLDIER
WHAT IS HIS REPUTATION WITH THE DUKE?
PAROLLES
THE DUKE KNOWS HIM FOR NO OTHER BUT A POOR OFFICER
OF MINE; AND WRIT TO ME THIS OTHER DAY TO TURN HIM
OUT O' THE BAND: I THINK I HAVE HIS LETTER IN MY POCKET.
FIRST SOLDIER
MARRY, WE'LL SEARCH.
PAROLLES
IN GOOD SADNESS, I DO NOT KNOW; EITHER IT IS THERE,
OR IT IS UPON A FILE WITH THE DUKE'S OTHER LETTERS
IN MY TENT.
FIRST SOLDIER
HERE 'TIS; HERE'S A PAPER: SHALL I READ IT TO YOU?
PAROLLES
I DO NOT KNOW IF IT BE IT OR NO.
BERTRAM
OUR INTERPRETER DOES IT WELL.
FIRST LORD
EXCELLENTLY.
FIRST SOLDIER
[READS] 'DIAN, THE COUNT'S A FOOL, AND FULL OF GOLD,'--
PAROLLES
THAT IS NOT THE DUKE'S LETTER, SIR; THAT IS AN
ADVERTISEMENT TO A PROPER MAID IN FLORENCE, ONE
DIANA, TO TAKE HEED OF THE ALLUREMENT OF ONE COUNT
ROUSILLON, A FOOLISH IDLE BOY, BUT FOR ALL THAT VERY
RUTTISH: I PRAY YOU, SIR, PUT IT UP AGAIN.
FIRST SOLDIER
NAY, I'LL READ IT FIRST, BY YOUR FAVOUR.
PAROLLES
MY MEANING IN'T, I PROTEST, WAS VERY HONEST IN THE
BEHALF OF THE MAID; FOR I KNEW THE YOUNG COUNT TO BE
A DANGEROUS AND LASCIVIOUS BOY, WHO IS A WHALE TO
VIRGINITY AND DEVOURS UP ALL THE FRY IT FINDS.
BERTRAM
DAMNABLE BOTH-SIDES ROGUE!
FIRST SOLDIER
[READS] 'WHEN HE SWEARS OATHS, BID HIM DROP GOLD, AND TAKE IT;
AFTER HE SCORES, HE NEVER PAYS THE SCORE:
HALF WON IS MATCH WELL MADE; MATCH, AND WELL MAKE IT;
HE NE'ER PAYS AFTER-DEBTS, TAKE IT BEFORE;
AND SAY A SOLDIER, DIAN, TOLD THEE THIS,
MEN ARE TO MELL WITH, BOYS ARE NOT TO KISS:
FOR COUNT OF THIS, THE COUNT'S A FOOL, I KNOW IT,
WHO PAYS BEFORE, BUT NOT WHEN HE DOES OWE IT.
THINE, AS HE VOWED TO THEE IN THINE EAR,
PAROLLES.'
BERTRAM
HE SHALL BE WHIPPED THROUGH THE ARMY WITH THIS RHYME
IN'S FOREHEAD.
SECOND LORD
THIS IS YOUR DEVOTED FRIEND, SIR, THE MANIFOLD
LINGUIST AND THE ARMIPOTENT SOLDIER.
BERTRAM
I COULD ENDURE ANY THING BEFORE BUT A CAT, AND NOW
HE'S A CAT TO ME.
FIRST SOLDIER
I PERCEIVE, SIR, BY THE GENERAL'S LOOKS, WE SHALL BE
FAIN TO HANG YOU.
PAROLLES
MY LIFE, SIR, IN ANY CASE: NOT THAT I AM AFRAID TO
DIE; BUT THAT, MY OFFENCES BEING MANY, I WOULD
REPENT OUT THE REMAINDER OF NATURE: LET ME LIVE,
SIR, IN A DUNGEON, I' THE STOCKS, OR ANY WHERE, SO I MAY LIVE.
FIRST SOLDIER
WE'LL SEE WHAT MAY BE DONE, SO YOU CONFESS FREELY;
THEREFORE, ONCE MORE TO THIS CAPTAIN DUMAIN: YOU
HAVE ANSWERED TO HIS REPUTATION WITH THE DUKE AND TO
HIS VALOUR: WHAT IS HIS HONESTY?
PAROLLES
HE WILL STEAL, SIR, AN EGG OUT OF A CLOISTER: FOR
RAPES AND RAVISHMENTS HE PARALLELS NESSUS: HE
PROFESSES NOT KEEPING OF OATHS; IN BREAKING 'EM HE
IS STRONGER THAN HERCULES: HE WILL LIE, SIR, WITH
SUCH VOLUBILITY, THAT YOU WOULD THINK TRUTH WERE A
FOOL: DRUNKENNESS IS HIS BEST VIRTUE, FOR HE WILL
BE SWINE-DRUNK; AND IN HIS SLEEP HE DOES LITTLE
HARM, SAVE TO HIS BED-CLOTHES ABOUT HIM; BUT THEY
KNOW HIS CONDITIONS AND LAY HIM IN STRAW. I HAVE BUT
LITTLE MORE TO SAY, SIR, OF HIS HONESTY: HE HAS
EVERY THING THAT AN HONEST MAN SHOULD NOT HAVE; WHAT
AN HONEST MAN SHOULD HAVE, HE HAS NOTHING.
FIRST LORD
I BEGIN TO LOVE HIM FOR THIS.
BERTRAM
FOR THIS DESCRIPTION OF THINE HONESTY? A POX UPON
HIM FOR ME, HE'S MORE AND MORE A CAT.
FIRST SOLDIER
WHAT SAY YOU TO HIS EXPERTNESS IN WAR?
PAROLLES
FAITH, SIR, HE HAS LED THE DRUM BEFORE THE ENGLISH
TRAGEDIANS; TO BELIE HIM, I WILL NOT, AND MORE OF
HIS SOLDIERSHIP I KNOW NOT; EXCEPT, IN THAT COUNTRY
HE HAD THE HONOUR TO BE THE OFFICER AT A PLACE THERE
CALLED MILE-END, TO INSTRUCT FOR THE DOUBLING OF
FILES: I WOULD DO THE MAN WHAT HONOUR I CAN, BUT OF
THIS I AM NOT CERTAIN.
FIRST LORD
HE HATH OUT-VILLAINED VILLANY SO FAR, THAT THE
RARITY REDEEMS HIM.
BERTRAM
A POX ON HIM, HE'S A CAT STILL.
FIRST SOLDIER
HIS QUALITIES BEING AT THIS POOR PRICE, I NEED NOT
TO ASK YOU IF GOLD WILL CORRUPT HIM TO REVOLT.
PAROLLES
SIR, FOR A QUART D'ECU HE WILL SELL THE FEE-SIMPLE
OF HIS SALVATION, THE INHERITANCE OF IT; AND CUT THE
ENTAIL FROM ALL REMAINDERS, AND A PERPETUAL
SUCCESSION FOR IT PERPETUALLY.
FIRST SOLDIER
WHAT'S HIS BROTHER, THE OTHER CAPTAIN DUMAIN?
SECOND LORD
WHY DOES BE ASK HIM OF ME?
FIRST SOLDIER
WHAT'S HE?
PAROLLES
E'EN A CROW O' THE SAME NEST; NOT ALTOGETHER SO
GREAT AS THE FIRST IN GOODNESS, BUT GREATER A GREAT
DEAL IN EVIL: HE EXCELS HIS BROTHER FOR A COWARD,
YET HIS BROTHER IS REPUTED ONE OF THE BEST THAT IS:
IN A RETREAT HE OUTRUNS ANY LACKEY; MARRY, IN COMING
ON HE HAS THE CRAMP.
FIRST SOLDIER
IF YOUR LIFE BE SAVED, WILL YOU UNDERTAKE TO BETRAY
THE FLORENTINE?
PAROLLES
AY, AND THE CAPTAIN OF HIS HORSE, COUNT ROUSILLON.
FIRST SOLDIER
I'LL WHISPER WITH THE GENERAL, AND KNOW HIS PLEASURE.
PAROLLES
[ASIDE] I'LL NO MORE DRUMMING; A PLAGUE OF ALL
DRUMS! ONLY TO SEEM TO DESERVE WELL, AND TO
BEGUILE THE SUPPOSITION OF THAT LASCIVIOUS YOUNG BOY
THE COUNT, HAVE I RUN INTO THIS DANGER. YET WHO
WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED AN AMBUSH WHERE I WAS TAKEN?
FIRST SOLDIER
THERE IS NO REMEDY, SIR, BUT YOU MUST DIE: THE
GENERAL SAYS, YOU THAT HAVE SO TRAITOROUSLY
DISCOVERED THE SECRETS OF YOUR ARMY AND MADE SUCH
PESTIFEROUS REPORTS OF MEN VERY NOBLY HELD, CAN
SERVE THE WORLD FOR NO HONEST USE; THEREFORE YOU
MUST DIE. COME, HEADSMAN, OFF WITH HIS HEAD.
PAROLLES
O LORD, SIR, LET ME LIVE, OR LET ME SEE MY DEATH!
FIRST LORD
THAT SHALL YOU, AND TAKE YOUR LEAVE OF ALL YOUR FRIENDS.
UNBLINDING HIM

SO, LOOK ABOUT YOU: KNOW YOU ANY HERE?
BERTRAM
GOOD MORROW, NOBLE CAPTAIN.
SECOND LORD
GOD BLESS YOU, CAPTAIN PAROLLES.
FIRST LORD
GOD SAVE YOU, NOBLE CAPTAIN.
SECOND LORD
CAPTAIN, WHAT GREETING WILL YOU TO MY LORD LAFEU?
I AM FOR FRANCE.
FIRST LORD
GOOD CAPTAIN, WILL YOU GIVE ME A COPY OF THE SONNET
YOU WRIT TO DIANA IN BEHALF OF THE COUNT ROUSILLON?
AN I WERE NOT A VERY COWARD, I'LD COMPEL IT OF YOU:
BUT FARE YOU WELL.

THIS HOUR, AND YOUR SON HERE AT HOME, MORE ADVANCED
BY THE KING THAN BY THAT RED-TAILED HUMBLE-BEE I SPEAK OF.
COUNTESS
I WOULD I HAD NOT KNOWN HIM; IT WAS THE DEATH OF THE

NOT ONE WORD MORE OF THE CONSUMED TIME.
LET'S TAKE THE INSTANT BY THE FORWARD TOP;
FOR WE ARE OLD, AND ON OUR QUICK'ST DECREES
THE INAUDIBLE AND NOISELESS FOOT OF TIME
STEALS ERE WE CAN EFFECT THEM. YOU REMEMBER
THE DAUGHTER OF THIS LORD?
BERTRAM
ADMIRINGLY, MY LIEGE, AT FIRST
I STUCK MY CHOICE UPON HER, ERE MY HEART
DURST MAKE TOO BOLD A HERALD OF MY TONGUE
WHERE THE IMPRESSION OF MINE EYE INFIXING,
CONTEMPT HIS SCORNFUL PERSPECTIVE DID LEND ME,
WHICH WARP'D THE LINE OF EVERY OTHER FAVOUR;
SCORN'D A FAIR COLOUR, OR EXPRESS'D IT STOLEN;
EXTENDED OR CONTRACTED ALL PROPORTIONS
TO A MOST HIDEOUS OBJECT: THENCE IT CAME
THAT SHE WHOM ALL MEN PRAISED AND WHOM MYSELF,
SINCE I HAVE LOST, HAVE LOVED, WAS IN MINE EYE
THE DUST THAT DID OFFEND IT.
KING
WELL EXCUSED:
THAT THOU DIDST LOVE HER, STRIKES SOME SCORES AWAY
FROM THE GREAT COMPT: BUT LOVE THAT COMES TOO LATE,
LIKE A REMORSEFUL PARDON SLOWLY CARRIED,
TO THE GREAT SENDER TURNS A SOUR OFFENCE,
CRYING, 'THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GONE.' OUR RASH FAULTS
MAKE TRIVIAL PRICE OF SERIOUS THINGS WE HAVE,
NOT KNOWING THEM UNTIL WE KNOW THEIR GRAVE:
OFT OUR DISPLEASURES, TO OURSELVES UNJUST,
DESTROY OUR FRIENDS AND AFTER WEEP THEIR DUST
OUR OWN LOVE WAKING CRIES TO SEE WHAT'S DONE,
WHILE SHAME FULL LATE SLEEPS OUT THE AFTERNOON.
BE THIS SWEET HELEN'S KNELL, AND NOW FORGET HER.
SEND FORTH YOUR AMOROUS TOKEN FOR FAIR MAUDLIN:
THE MAIN CONSENTS ARE HAD; AND HERE WE'LL STAY
TO SEE OUR WIDOWER'S SECOND MARRIAGE-DAY.
COUNTESS
WHICH BETTER THAN THE FIRST, O DEAR HEAVEN, BLESS!
OR, ERE THEY MEET, IN ME, O NATURE, CESSE!
LAFEU
COME ON, MY SON, IN WHOM MY HOUSE'S NAME
MUST BE DIGESTED, GIVE A FAVOUR FROM YOU
TO SPARKLE IN THE SPIRITS OF MY DAUGHTER,
THAT SHE MAY QUICKLY COME.
BERTRAM GIVES A RING

BY MY OLD BEARD,
AND EVERY HAIR THAT'S ON'T, HELEN, THAT'S DEAD,
WAS A SWEET CREATURE: SUCH A RING AS THIS,
THE LAST THAT E'ER I TOOK HER AT COURT,
I SAW UPON HER FINGER.
BERTRAM
HERS IT WAS NOT.
KING
NOW, PRAY YOU, LET ME SEE IT; FOR MINE EYE,
WHILE I WAS SPEAKING, OFT WAS FASTEN'D TO'T.
THIS RING WAS MINE; AND, WHEN I GAVE IT HELEN,
I BADE HER, IF HER FORTUNES EVER STOOD
NECESSITIED TO HELP, THAT BY THIS TOKEN
I WOULD RELIEVE HER. HAD YOU THAT CRAFT, TO REAVE
HER
OF WHAT SHOULD STEAD HER MOST?
BERTRAM
MY GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,
HOWE'ER IT PLEASES YOU TO TAKE IT SO,
THE RING WAS NEVER HERS.
COUNTESS
SON, ON MY LIFE,
I HAVE SEEN HER WEAR IT; AND SHE RECKON'D IT
AT HER LIFE'S RATE.
LAFEU
I AM SURE I SAW HER WEAR IT.
BERTRAM
YOU ARE DECEIVED, MY LORD; SHE NEVER SAW IT:
IN FLORENCE WAS IT FROM A CASEMENT THROWN ME,
WRAPP'D IN A PAPER, WHICH CONTAIN'D THE NAME
OF HER THAT THREW IT: NOBLE SHE WAS, AND THOUGHT
I STOOD ENGAGED: BUT WHEN I HAD SUBSCRIBED
TO MINE OWN FORTUNE AND INFORM'D HER FULLY
I COULD NOT ANSWER IN THAT COURSE OF HONOUR
AS SHE HAD MADE THE OVERTURE, SHE CEASED
IN HEAVY SATISFACTION AND WOULD NEVER
RECEIVE THE RING AGAIN.
KING
PLUTUS HIMSELF,
THAT KNOWS THE TINCT AND MULTIPLYING MEDICINE,
HATH NOT IN NATURE'S MYSTERY MORE SCIENCE
THAN I HAVE IN THIS RING: 'TWAS MINE, 'TWAS HELEN'S,
WHOEVER GAVE IT YOU. THEN, IF YOU KNOW
THAT YOU ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOURSELF,
CONFESS 'TWAS HERS, AND BY WHAT ROUGH ENFORCEMENT
YOU GOT IT FROM HER: SHE CALL'D THE SAINTS TO SURETY
THAT SHE WOULD NEVER PUT IT FROM HER FINGER,
UNLESS SHE GAVE IT TO YOURSELF IN BED,
WHERE YOU HAVE NEVER COME, OR SENT IT US
UPON HER GREAT DISASTER.
BERTRAM
SHE NEVER SAW IT.
KING
THOU SPEAK'ST IT FALSELY, AS I LOVE MINE HONOUR;
AND MAKEST CONJECTURAL FEARS TO COME INTO ME
WHICH I WOULD FAIN SHUT OUT. IF IT SHOULD PROVE
THAT THOU ART SO INHUMAN,--'TWILL NOT PROVE SO;--
AND YET I KNOW NOT: THOU DIDST HATE HER DEADLY,
AND SHE IS DEAD; WHICH NOTHING, BUT TO CLOSE
HER EYES MYSELF, COULD WIN ME TO BELIEVE,
MORE THAN TO SEE THIS RING. TAKE HIM AWAY.
GUARDS SEIZE BERTRAM

MY FORE-PAST PROOFS, HOWE'ER THE MATTER FALL,
SHALL TAX MY FEARS OF LITTLE VANITY,
HAVING VAINLY FEAR'D TOO LITTLE. AWAY WITH HIM!
WE'LL SIFT THIS MATTER FURTHER.
BERTRAM
IF YOU SHALL PROVE
THIS RING WAS EVER HERS, YOU SHALL AS EASY
PROVE THAT I HUSBANDED HER BED IN FLORENCE,
WHERE YET SHE NEVER WAS.
EXIT, GUARDED

KING
I AM WRAPP'D IN DISMAL THINKINGS.
ENTER A GENTLEMAN

GENTLEMAN
GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,
WHETHER I HAVE BEEN TO BLAME OR NO, I KNOW NOT:
HERE'S A PETITION FROM A FLORENTINE,
WHO HATH FOR FOUR OR FIVE REMOVES COME SHORT
TO TENDER IT HERSELF. I UNDERTOOK IT,
VANQUISH'D THERETO BY THE FAIR GRACE AND SPEECH
OF THE POOR SUPPLIANT, WHO BY THIS I KNOW
IS HERE ATTENDING: HER BUSINESS LOOKS IN HER
WITH AN IMPORTING VISAGE; AND SHE TOLD ME,
IN A SWEET VERBAL BRIEF, IT DID CONCERN
YOUR HIGHNESS WITH HERSELF.
KING
[READS] UPON HIS MANY PROTESTATIONS TO MARRY ME
WHEN HIS WIFE WAS DEAD, I BLUSH TO SAY IT, HE WON
ME. NOW IS THE COUNT ROUSILLON A WIDOWER: HIS VOWS
ARE FORFEITED TO ME, AND MY HONOUR'S PAID TO HIM. HE
STOLE FROM FLORENCE, TAKING NO LEAVE, AND I FOLLOW
HIM TO HIS COUNTRY FOR JUSTICE: GRANT IT ME, O
KING! IN YOU IT BEST LIES; OTHERWISE A SEDUCER
FLOURISHES, AND A POOR MAID IS UNDONE.
DIANA CAPILET.
LAFEU
I WILL BUY ME A SON-IN-LAW IN A FAIR, AND TOLL FOR
THIS: I'LL NONE OF HIM.
KING
THE HEAVENS HAVE THOUGHT WELL ON THEE LAFEU,
TO BRING FORTH THIS DISCOVERY. SEEK THESE SUITORS:
GO SPEEDILY AND BRING AGAIN THE COUNT.
I AM AFEARD THE LIFE OF HELEN, LADY,
WAS FOULLY SNATCH'D.
COUNTESS
NOW, JUSTICE ON THE DOERS!
RE-ENTER BERTRAM, GUARDED

KING
I WONDER, SIR, SITH WIVES ARE MONSTERS TO YOU,
AND THAT YOU FLY THEM AS YOU SWEAR THEM LORDSHIP,
YET YOU DESIRE TO MARRY.
ENTER WIDOW AND DIANA

WHAT WOMAN'S THAT?
DIANA
I AM, MY LORD, A WRETCHED FLORENTINE,
DERIVED FROM THE ANCIENT CAPILET:
MY SUIT, AS I DO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW,
AND THEREFORE KNOW HOW FAR I MAY BE PITIED.
WIDOW
I AM HER MOTHER, SIR, WHOSE AGE AND HONOUR
BOTH SUFFER UNDER THIS COMPLAINT WE BRING,
AND BOTH SHALL CEASE, WITHOUT YOUR REMEDY.
KING
COME HITHER, COUNT; DO YOU KNOW THESE WOMEN?
BERTRAM
MY LORD, I NEITHER CAN NOR WILL DENY
BUT THAT I KNOW THEM: DO THEY CHARGE ME FURTHER?
DIANA
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO STRANGE UPON YOUR WIFE?
BERTRAM
SHE'S NONE OF MINE, MY LORD.
DIANA
IF YOU SHALL MARRY,
YOU GIVE AWAY THIS HAND, AND THAT IS MINE;
YOU GIVE AWAY HEAVEN'S VOWS, AND THOSE ARE MINE;
YOU GIVE AWAY MYSELF, WHICH IS KNOWN MINE;
FOR I BY VOW AM SO EMBODIED YOURS,
THAT SHE WHICH MARRIES YOU MUST MARRY ME,
EITHER BOTH OR NONE.
LAFEU
YOUR REPUTATION COMES TOO SHORT FOR MY DAUGHTER; YOU
ARE NO HUSBAND FOR HER.
BERTRAM
MY LORD, THIS IS A FOND AND DESPERATE CREATURE,
WHOM SOMETIME I HAVE LAUGH'D WITH: LET YOUR HIGHNESS
LAY A MORE NOBLE THOUGHT UPON MINE HONOUR
THAN FOR TO THINK THAT I WOULD SINK IT HERE.
KING
SIR, FOR MY THOUGHTS, YOU HAVE THEM ILL TO FRIEND
TILL YOUR DEEDS GAIN THEM: FAIRER PROVE YOUR HONOUR
THAN IN MY THOUGHT IT LIES.
DIANA
GOOD MY LORD,
ASK HIM UPON HIS OATH, IF HE DOES THINK
HE HAD NOT MY VIRGINITY.
KING
WHAT SAY'ST THOU TO HER?
BERTRAM
SHE'S IMPUDENT, MY LORD,
AND WAS A COMMON GAMESTER TO THE CAMP.
DIANA
HE DOES ME WRONG, MY LORD; IF I WERE SO,
HE MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT ME AT A COMMON PRICE:
DO NOT BELIEVE HIM. O, BEHOLD THIS RING,
WHOSE HIGH RESPECT AND RICH VALIDITY
DID LACK A PARALLEL; YET FOR ALL THAT
HE GAVE IT TO A COMMONER O' THE CAMP,
IF I BE ONE.
COUNTESS
HE BLUSHES, AND 'TIS IT:
OF SIX PRECEDING ANCESTORS, THAT GEM,
CONFERR'D BY TESTAMENT TO THE SEQUENT ISSUE,
HATH IT BEEN OWED AND WORN. THIS IS HIS WIFE;
THAT RING'S A THOUSAND PROOFS.
KING
METHOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU SAW ONE HERE IN COURT COULD WITNESS IT.
DIANA
I DID, MY LORD, BUT LOATH AM TO PRODUCE
SO BAD AN INSTRUMENT: HIS NAME'S PAROLLES.
LAFEU
I SAW THE MAN TO-DAY, IF MAN HE BE.
KING
FIND HIM, AND BRING HIM HITHER.
EXIT AN ATTENDANT

BERTRAM
WHAT OF HIM?
HE'S QUOTED FOR A MOST PERFIDIOUS SLAVE,
WITH ALL THE SPOTS O' THE WORLD TAX'D AND DEBOSH'D;
WHOSE NATURE SICKENS BUT TO SPEAK A TRUTH.
AM I OR THAT OR THIS FOR WHAT HE'LL UTTER,
THAT WILL SPEAK ANY THING?
KING
SHE HATH THAT RING OF YOURS.
BERTRAM
I THINK SHE HAS: CERTAIN IT IS I LIKED HER,
AND BOARDED HER I' THE WANTON WAY OF YOUTH:
SHE KNEW HER DISTANCE AND DID ANGLE FOR ME,
MADDING MY EAGERNESS WITH HER RESTRAINT,
AS ALL IMPEDIMENTS IN FANCY'S COURSE
ARE MOTIVES OF MORE FANCY; AND, IN FINE,
HER INFINITE CUNNING, WITH HER MODERN GRACE,
SUBDUED ME TO HER RATE: SHE GOT THE RING;
AND I HAD THAT WHICH ANY INFERIOR MIGHT
AT MARKET-PRICE HAVE BOUGHT.
DIANA
I MUST BE PATIENT:
YOU, THAT HAVE TURN'D OFF A FIRST SO NOBLE WIFE,
MAY JUSTLY DIET ME. I PRAY YOU YET;
SINCE YOU LACK VIRTUE, I WILL LOSE A HUSBAND;
SEND FOR YOUR RING, I WILL RETURN IT HOME,
AND GIVE ME MINE AGAIN.
BERTRAM
I HAVE IT NOT.
KING
WHAT RING WAS YOURS, I PRAY YOU?
DIANA
SIR, MUCH LIKE
THE SAME UPON YOUR FINGER.
KING
KNOW YOU THIS RING? THIS RING WAS HIS OF LATE.
DIANA
AND THIS WAS IT I GAVE HIM, BEING ABED.
KING
THE STORY THEN GOES FALSE, YOU THREW IT HIM
OUT OF A CASEMENT.
DIANA
I HAVE SPOKE THE TRUTH.
ENTER PAROLLES

BERTRAM
MY LORD, I DO CONFESS THE RING WAS HERS.
KING
YOU BOGGLE SHREWDLY, EVERY FEATHER STARS YOU.
IS THIS THE MAN YOU SPEAK OF?
DIANA
AY, MY LORD.
KING
TELL ME, SIRRAH, BUT TELL ME TRUE, I CHARGE YOU,
NOT FEARING THE DISPLEASURE OF YOUR MASTER,
WHICH ON YOUR JUST PROCEEDING I'LL KEEP OFF,
BY HIM AND BY THIS WOMAN HERE WHAT KNOW YOU?
PAROLLES
SO PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY, MY MASTER HATH BEEN AN
HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN: TRICKS HE HATH HAD IN HIM,
WHICH GENTLEMEN HAVE.
KING
COME, COME, TO THE PURPOSE: DID HE LOVE THIS WOMAN?
PAROLLES
FAITH, SIR, HE DID LOVE HER; BUT HOW?
KING
HOW, I PRAY YOU?
PAROLLES
HE DID LOVE HER, SIR, AS A GENTLEMAN LOVES A WOMAN.
KING
HOW IS THAT?
PAROLLES
HE LOVED HER, SIR, AND LOVED HER NOT.
KING
AS THOU ART A KNAVE, AND NO KNAVE. WHAT AN
EQUIVOCAL COMPANION IS THIS!
PAROLLES
I AM A POOR MAN, AND AT YOUR MAJESTY'S COMMAND.
LAFEU
HE'S A GOOD DRUM, MY LORD, BUT A NAUGHTY ORATOR.
DIANA
DO YOU KNOW HE PROMISED ME MARRIAGE?
PAROLLES
FAITH, I KNOW MORE THAN I'LL SPEAK.
KING
BUT WILT THOU NOT SPEAK ALL THOU KNOWEST?
PAROLLES
YES, SO PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY. I DID GO BETWEEN THEM,
AS I SAID; BUT MORE THAN THAT, HE LOVED HER: FOR
INDEED HE WAS MAD FOR HER, AND TALKED OF SATAN AND
OF LIMBO AND OF FURIES AND I KNOW NOT WHAT: YET I
WAS IN THAT CREDIT WITH THEM AT THAT TIME THAT I
KNEW OF THEIR GOING TO BED, AND OF OTHER MOTIONS,
AS PROMISING HER MARRIAGE, AND THINGS WHICH WOULD
DERIVE ME ILL WILL TO SPEAK OF; THEREFORE I WILL NOT
SPEAK WHAT I KNOW.
KING
THOU HAST SPOKEN ALL ALREADY, UNLESS THOU CANST SAY
THEY ARE MARRIED: BUT THOU ART TOO FINE IN THY
EVIDENCE; THEREFORE STAND ASIDE.
THIS RING, YOU SAY, WAS YOURS?
DIANA
AY, MY GOOD LORD.
KING
WHERE DID YOU BUY IT? OR WHO GAVE IT YOU?
DIANA
IT WAS NOT GIVEN ME, NOR I DID NOT BUY IT.
KING
WHO LENT IT YOU?
DIANA
IT WAS NOT LENT ME NEITHER.
KING
WHERE DID YOU FIND IT, THEN?
DIANA
I FOUND IT NOT.
KING
IF IT WERE YOURS BY NONE OF ALL THESE WAYS,
HOW COULD YOU GIVE IT HIM?
DIANA
I NEVER GAVE IT HIM.
LAFEU
THIS WOMAN'S AN EASY GLOVE, MY LORD; SHE GOES OFF
AND ON AT PLEASURE.
KING
THIS RING WAS MINE; I GAVE IT HIS FIRST WIFE.
DIANA
IT MIGHT BE YOURS OR HERS, FOR AUGHT I KNOW.
KING
TAKE HER AWAY; I DO NOT LIKE HER NOW;
TO PRISON WITH HER: AND AWAY WITH HIM.
UNLESS THOU TELL'ST ME WHERE THOU HADST THIS RING,
THOU DIEST WITHIN THIS HOUR.
DIANA
I'LL NEVER TELL YOU.
KING
TAKE HER AWAY.
DIANA
I'LL PUT IN BAIL, MY LIEGE.
KING
I THINK THEE NOW SOME COMMON CUSTOMER.
DIANA
BY JOVE, IF EVER I KNEW MAN, 'TWAS YOU.
KING
WHEREFORE HAST THOU ACCUSED HIM ALL THIS WHILE?
DIANA
BECAUSE HE'S GUILTY, AND HE IS NOT GUILTY:
HE KNOWS I AM NO MAID, AND HE'LL SWEAR TO'T;
I'LL SWEAR I AM A MAID, AND HE KNOWS NOT.
GREAT KING, I AM NO STRUMPET, BY MY LIFE;
I AM EITHER MAID, OR ELSE THIS OLD MAN'S WIFE.
KING
SHE DOES ABUSE OUR EARS: TO PRISON WITH HER.
DIANA
GOOD MOTHER, FETCH MY BAIL. STAY, ROYAL SIR:
EXIT WIDOW

THE JEWELLER THAT OWES THE RING IS SENT FOR,
AND HE SHALL SURETY ME. BUT FOR THIS LORD,
WHO HATH ABUSED ME, AS HE KNOWS HIMSELF,
THOUGH YET HE NEVER HARM'D ME, HERE I QUIT HIM:
HE KNOWS HIMSELF MY BED HE HATH DEFILED;
AND AT THAT TIME HE GOT HIS WIFE WITH CHILD:
DEAD THOUGH SHE BE, SHE FEELS HER YOUNG ONE KICK:
SO THERE'S MY RIDDLE: ONE THAT'S DEAD IS QUICK:
AND NOW BEHOLD THE MEANING.
RE-ENTER WIDOW, WITH HELENA

KING
IS THERE NO EXORCIST
BEGUILES THE TRUER OFFICE OF MINE EYES?
IS'T REAL THAT I SEE?
HELENA
NO, MY GOOD LORD;
'TIS BUT THE SHADOW OF A WIFE YOU SEE,
THE NAME AND NOT THE THING.
BERTRAM
BOTH, BOTH. O, PARDON!
HELENA
O MY GOOD LORD, WHEN I WAS LIKE THIS MAID,
I FOUND YOU WONDROUS KIND. THERE IS YOUR RING;
AND, LOOK YOU, HERE'S YOUR LETTER; THIS IT SAYS:
'WHEN FROM MY FINGER YOU CAN GET THIS RING
AND ARE BY ME WITH CHILD,' & C. THIS IS DONE:
WILL YOU BE MINE, NOW YOU ARE DOUBLY WON?
BERTRAM
IF SHE, MY LIEGE, CAN MAKE ME KNOW THIS CLEARLY,
I'LL LOVE HER DEARLY, EVER, EVER DEARLY.
HELENA
IF IT APPEAR NOT PLAIN AND PROVE UNTRUE,
DEADLY DIVORCE STEP BETWEEN ME AND YOU!
O MY DEAR MOTHER, DO I SEE YOU LIVING?
LAFEU
MINE EYES SMELL ONIONS; I SHALL WEEP ANON:
TO PAROLLES

GOOD TOM DRUM, LEND ME A HANDKERCHER: SO,
I THANK THEE: WAIT ON ME HOME, I'LL MAKE SPORT WITH THEE:
LET THY COURTESIES ALONE, THEY ARE SCURVY ONES.
KING
LET US FROM POINT TO POINT THIS STORY KNOW,
TO MAKE THE EVEN TRUTH IN PLEASURE FLOW.
TO DIANA

IF THOU BE'ST YET A FRESH UNCROPPED FLOWER,
CHOOSE THOU THY HUSBAND, AND I'LL PAY THY DOWER;
FOR I CAN GUESS THAT BY THY HONEST AID
THOU KEEP'ST A WIFE HERSELF, THYSELF A MAID.
OF THAT AND ALL THE PROGRESS, MORE OR LESS,
RESOLVEDLY MORE LEISURE SHALL EXPRESS:
ALL YET SEEMS WELL; AND IF IT END SO MEET,
THE BITTER PAST, MORE WELCOME IS THE SWEET.
FLOURISH

EPILOGUE
KING
THE KING'S A BEGGAR, NOW THE PLAY IS DONE:
ALL IS WELL ENDED, IF THIS SUIT BE WON,
THAT YOU EXPRESS CONTENT; WHICH WE WILL PAY,
WITH STRIFE TO PLEASE YOU, DAY EXCEEDING DAY:
OURS BE YOUR PATIENCE THEN, AND YOURS OUR PARTS;
YOUR GENTLE HANDS LEND US, AND TAKE OUR HEARTS.
EXEUNT
